        "input": "$Part 1 of Experimental protocol to be processed$: Part 1: Sample Collection and Preparation\n\nBegin the process by downloading raw gene counts for tumor and normal tissue samples from the Recount3 R package (version 1.0). Ensure the raw reads from multiple sources, including cancer and non-diseased tissues generated by the TCGA and GTEx, are uniformly processed using the STAR (version 2.7.3a) and Megadepth (version 1.0.1) pipeline. Align and quantify the reads to the UCSC hg38 assembly. Specifically, download data for the TCGA-SARC and GTEx projects, focusing on putative sarcomagenic tissues of mesenchymal origin, such as adipose, fibroblasts, skeletal muscle, esophagus muscularis, stomach, uterus, and vessels. Use the following example command for data download: 'R\nlibrary(recount3)\nproject_info <- available_projects()\ndata_sarc <- create_rse(project = 'TCGA-SARC')\ndata_gtex <- create_rse(project = 'GTEx')'. Ensure all downloaded data is accessible and stored securely for further analysis. Verify data integrity by checking file sizes and using checksums. Store the data in a secure and organized manner, documenting each step for reproducibility. Refer to the Recount3 documentation for additional guidance and troubleshooting steps. Maintain a checklist for verifying data integrity and storage conditions.\n\nSelect tumor samples from the TCGA SARC project and normal samples from GTEx projects. Focus on highly differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma subtypes. Ensure samples meet selection criteria, such as tissue site specificity and quality metrics (e.g., percentage of aligned reads > 70%). Filter out low-quality and non-primary tumor samples. Modify subtype classification based on expert pathology reviews to ensure accurate representation of liposarcoma subtypes. Document the filtering process and quality assessment steps meticulously. Use tools such as FastQC for quality assessment and follow specific guidelines for RNA-seq sample selection. Maintain a checklist for verifying sample quality and selection criteria. Include references to relevant literature or guidelines for sample selection.\n\nPreprocess the raw gene counts by mapping genomic features to an Entrez ID using the org.Hs.eg.db Bioconductor package (version 3.12.0). Normalize the downloaded raw counts for all samples using the Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) method with the edgeR package (version 3.32.1). Obtain normalized counts in the log scale using the voom function from the limma package (version 3.46.0). Perform quality control checks including data distribution visualization and outlier detection to ensure data integrity. Include explicit instructions on handling potential issues such as missing data or outliers. Refer to relevant literature or guidelines for preprocessing RNA-seq data. Maintain a checklist for verifying data integrity and preprocessing criteria. Provide a brief overview of the preprocessing step, outlining the purpose and expected outcomes.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 1 of experimental protocol. Your task is to accurately identify and extract sections that correspond to dry experiments, which are defined as data downloading, data processing, computational analysis, or other activities not involving wet-lab procedures.\n\nFor each identified dry experimental step, focus on detailing:\n- A clear task description.\n- The specific inputs required, along with their detailed description and types.\n- The expected outputs, including their detailed description and types.\n\nEnsure that your extraction is specific to dry experiments.

        "input": "$Part 4 of Experimental protocol to be processed$: Part 4: Single-Cell Sequencing and Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis\n\nI. Preparation of Single-Cell Suspensions from Tumor Samples: Fresh tumor samples from the available frozen samples are thawed and cut into small pieces. These pieces are then dissociated using a digestion medium consisting of CO2-independent medium (Gibco) with 150 mg/ml Liberase TL (Roche) and 100 U/ml DNase 1 (Sigma Aldrich), incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. The resulting cell suspension is filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer to remove debris. Cells are washed with PBS and counted using a hemocytometer. Viability is assessed using trypan blue exclusion, ensuring a viability of at least 85%. Cells are resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 million cells/ml and stored on ice until further processing. Ensure that samples are processed within 2 hours to maintain cell viability.\n\nII. Single-cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) Analysis: Single-cell suspensions are loaded onto a 10X Genomics Chromium Controller using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Kit v3, targeting 3000 cells per sample. Libraries are prepared following the manufacturer's protocol, including reverse transcription, cDNA amplification, and library construction. Sequencing is performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform, aiming for a depth of at least 50,000 reads per cell. Raw sequencing data are processed using Cell Ranger (v6.0.0), aligning reads to the GRCh38 reference genome and generating a gene-cell matrix. Verify the integrity of the generated matrix by assessing the number of detected genes per cell and the distribution of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).\n\nIII. Integration and Clustering of scRNA-seq Data: Processed data from Cell Ranger are imported into Seurat (v4.1.0) for integration and clustering. Data are normalized using the SCTransform function, and the 3000 most variable genes are identified. PCA is performed on these genes, and the first 50 principal components are used for clustering. UMAP is used for dimensionality reduction, and shared nearest-neighbor graph-based clustering is performed using the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions with a resolution of 0.6 to identify cell clusters. Ensure that clustering results are validated by visual inspection of UMAP plots and by comparing with known cell type markers.\n\nIV. Identification of Tumor Cell Clusters and Metabolic Pathways: Differential gene expression analysis is conducted using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat, employing a Wilcoxon rank sum test with Bonferroni correction. Genes with a log2-fold change ≥0.4 and an adjusted p-value ≤0.05 are considered significant. Pathway analysis is performed using Toppfun with a p-value cutoff of 0.05 to identify enriched metabolic pathways, focusing on pathways like lipid metabolism and TGF-β signaling. Include a rationale for selecting specific pathways based on previous literature and study objectives.\n\nV. Validation of Bulk RNA-seq Findings with Single-cell Data: Bulk RNA-seq data from GSE221492 are compared with single-cell RNA-seq data from GSE221493. Differential expression analysis at the single-cell level is performed using DESeq2, aligning reads to the GRCh38 reference genome. Clustering and pathway analysis results from single-cell data are cross-referenced with bulk RNA-seq findings to validate the presence of identified metabolic pathways. Consistency in expression patterns and pathway enrichment between datasets is assessed using statistical tests to ensure robustness.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 4 of experimental protocol.

Validation of Differential Expression Results using Independent Datasets and Specific Criteria for Dataset Selection\n1. Identify independent datasets from GEO that include RNA-seq data for liposarcoma, focusing on datasets that provide both WDLPS and DDLPS samples. Use datasets GSE201056 and GSE213300 for validation purposes, as they contain relevant expression profiles.\n2. Download raw gene expression data and process using the same pipeline as in previous parts: align reads to the GRCh38 reference genome using STAR version 2.7.9a, normalize expression data using TPM values, and perform quality control checks with FastQC version 0.11.9 to ensure data integrity.\n3. Select DEGs identified in Part 3 and Part 4 and verify their expression patterns in the independent datasets. Use DESeq2 version 1.30.1 to re-evaluate differential expression and confirm consistency in expression patterns.\n4. Apply a significance threshold of adjusted p-value < 0.05 to identify validated DEGs. Document discrepancies and analyze potential reasons for any inconsistencies. Integrate RNA-seq data from the researcher's own 80 cases for additional validation.\n\nII. Pathway Enrichment Analysis to Identify Key Metabolic Pathways\n1. Utilize the validated DEGs from Step 1 to perform pathway enrichment analysis using the clusterProfiler package version 3.18.1. Focus on KEGG pathways related to metabolism to identify key metabolic pathways involved in liposarcoma differentiation.\n2. Set the FDR cutoff to p < 0.05 for pathway significance. Use the KEGG database version corresponding to the GRCh38 genome build for accurate pathway mapping.\n3. Visualize enriched pathways using dot plots and pathway maps generated with ggplot2 version 3.3.3 to highlight significant metabolic pathways. Prioritize pathways with the highest enrichment scores for further investigation.\n4. Document the top 10 enriched metabolic pathways and their biological functions, focusing on their relevance to liposarcoma biology and differentiation.\n\nIII. Cross-validation of Results with Publicly Available Datasets\n1. Cross-validate the pathway enrichment results with additional publicly available datasets such as GSE179720 and GSE221492. Ensure these datasets contain relevant liposarcoma samples and expression data.\n2. Perform pathway enrichment analysis on these datasets using the same parameters and criteria as in Step 2. Compare the results to identify common metabolic pathways enriched across multiple datasets.\n3. Analyze the consistency of pathway enrichment results and identify any novel pathways not previously detected. Document any new findings and their potential implications for liposarcoma differentiation.\n4.
