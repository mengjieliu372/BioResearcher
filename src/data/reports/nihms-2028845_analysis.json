        "Title": "Transcriptomics analysis using RNA-sequencing to identify cancer-type-associated heterogeneities in metabolic pathways",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "This part provides a comprehensive protocol on collecting and preprocessing RNA-sequencing data, which is highly relevant to the analysis of metabolic characteristics in liposarcoma using RNA-seq data.",
        "Suggestions": "You can use the RNA-sequencing data collection and preprocessing methods from this part. Specifically, the quality control steps using FastQC, read trimming with Trimmomatic, and normalization techniques using RSEM are directly applicable. Modify the dataset sources to include your 80 cases and any relevant publicly available datasets. Additionally, ensure to include steps for differential expression analysis and pathway enrichment specific to liposarcoma. Provide a detailed plan for integrating RNA-sequencing data from 80 cases with publicly available datasets and specify the quality control, normalization, and analysis steps."

        "Title": "Assessment of Oxphos state heterogeneity using single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing methods",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "While the focus is on Oxphos state heterogeneity, the methodologies for analyzing single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing data can be adapted to study metabolic characteristics in liposarcoma.",
        "Suggestions": "Use the single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis steps, including data preprocessing with CellRanger and clustering with Seurat. Modify the analysis to focus on metabolic pathway differences between highly differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Ensure to incorporate your single-cell sequencing data from 10 cases. Detail the steps for preprocessing and clustering single-cell RNA-sequencing data, including specific parameters and tools to be used. Provide a plan for identifying cell subpopulations and analyzing metabolic pathway differences."

    "Part 3": {
        "Title": "Multivariate modeling techniques to identify gene vulnerabilities associated with Oxphos state",
        "Referability": "Low",
        "Reason": "The focus on identifying gene vulnerabilities associated with Oxphos state may not be directly relevant to your objective of comparing metabolic characteristics in liposarcoma.",
        "Suggestions": "Consider using the feature selection and multivariate modeling techniques if you plan to explore gene vulnerabilities in liposarcoma. Adapt the feature selection and modeling techniques to focus on metabolic gene vulnerabilities in liposarcoma. Provide specific examples of how these techniques will be applied. Include a plan for validating the identified gene vulnerabilities using experimental data."

    "Part 4": {
        "Title": "Statistical analyses to reveal synthetically lethal associations between Oxphos state, driver mutations, and tissue context",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "The statistical analysis methods for identifying synthetically lethal associations can be adapted to analyze differences in metabolic characteristics between liposarcoma subtypes.",
        "Suggestions": "Use the statistical analysis techniques, such as permutation testing and comparison of gene dependencies, to identify significant differences in metabolic pathways between highly differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Provide detailed steps for performing permutation testing and comparing gene dependencies across liposarcoma subtypes. Include specific statistical methods and software to be used. Ensure that the analysis addresses the mandatory requirements and provides a clear plan for meeting them."

        "Title": "Experimental validation of PTEN loss predicting increased dependency on mitochondrial respiratory chain in OxphosHigh tumor cells",
        "Referability": "Low",
        "Reason": "The experimental validation focused on PTEN loss and mitochondrial dependency may not be directly applicable to your research on liposarcoma metabolic characteristics.",
        "Suggestions": "If your research identifies specific gene dependencies or metabolic vulnerabilities in liposarcoma, consider adapting the validation methods. Provide detailed steps for validating these vulnerabilities using available resources. Include a plan for analyzing the results and integrating them with the overall research objective."
