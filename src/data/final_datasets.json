            "Summary": "Amplification of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 is a common mechanism of P53 inactivation across human tumors. Here we investigated the impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin topology, gene expression and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma tumors and models. We identified three independent gene regulatory circuits that predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 family transcription factors bind a shared set of enhancers associated with mesenchymal lineage genes that underlie the developmental state of these tumors. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters associated with P53 pathways. When highly expressed, MDM2 also binds an additional set of P53-independent promoters that engage in multi-way physical interactions and regulate genes involved in cell division, RNA splicing, translation and stress responses. We find that liposarcoma cells with low to moderate MDM2 levels are sensitive to P53 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic agents, but that cells with very high-level MDM2 amplification and expression resist treatment. Hence, heterogeneity of MDM2 expression between and within tumors may compromise therapeutic regimens. In conclusion, we distinguished P53-dependent and P53-independent circuits in MDM2 copy number amplified tumors whose interplay has implications for targeted therapy.",

            "Summary": "Liposarcoma (LPS) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in adults. The two most frequent subtypes well differentiated (WD) and dedifferentiated (DD) LPS are often marked with the giant chromosome and the amplifications of chromosome 12q13-15. However, it remains unknown how this genomic aberrancy contributes to the dysregulation of the oncogenes. Here, we reported a comprehensive molecular characterization of both tumor and normal tissues from the same batch of LPS patients, including Hi-C, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and WGS datasets. We identified a library of tumor-specific enhancers that may play a critical role in oncogenesis. We also demonstrated the enhancer co-amplification and hijacking events involved with proto-oncogenes such as MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2, which have not been previously reported and as a novel mechanism to upregulate these genes. By combining Hi-C, optical mapping, Nanopore long reads and WGS data, we partially resolved complex structure variations (SVs) and reconstructed the local genome and the giant chromosome. We further validated the presence of multiple copies of  MDM2 and CDK4 are located on the giant chromosome by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Consequently, this study provides a comprehensive resource for further research in LPS.",
            "Overall design": "We started with 5 pairs of WD-LPS, 14 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples, and 1 DD-LPS cell line. Each pair of patient samples contains one tumor tissue and one matched peritumoral tissue as control. To profile the transcribed regions and to reveal the differential transcriptomes between tumors and peritumoral tissues, we performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) in all patient samples and cell lines. In 4 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples (P241, P298, P69 and P209) and 1 DD-LPS cell line (Lipo863B), we performed 1) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA-seq (ChIP-seq) for histone modifications H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), to chart the open chromatin regions and DD-LPS-specific regulatory elements, such as enhancers; 2) Hi-C experiments to study high-order chromatin structure and link distal enhancers to their target genes; 3) whole genome sequencing (WGS) to profile CNVs and dissect genome rearrangements. To better reveal the sequence details of genome rearrangements, we performed Nanopore long-read sequencing and BioNano optical mapping in Lipo863B cells to help assemble the rearranged regions. In total, we generated 71 genomic datasets, including 62 for the patient tissue samples and 9 for the cell line Lipo863B.Raw data not provided for patient samples due to patient privacy concerns.",

            "Summary": "Mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF or BAF) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes play critical roles in governing genomic architecture and gene expression and are frequently perturbed in human cancers. Transcription factors (TFs), including fusion oncoproteins, can bind to BAF complex surfaces to direct chromatin targeting and accessibility, often activating oncogenic gene loci. Here, we demonstrate that the FUS-DDIT3 fusion oncoprotein hallmark to myxoid liposarcoma (MLPS) inhibits BAF complex-mediated remodeling of adipogenic enhancer sites via sequestration of the adipogenic TF, CEBPB, from the genome. In mesenchymal stem cells, small molecule inhibition of BAF complex ATPase activity attenuates adipogenesis via failure of BAF-mediated DNA accessibility and gene activation at CEBPB target sites genome-wide. BAF chromatin targeting and gene expression profiles of FUS-DDIT3-expressing cell lines and primary tumors exhibit similarity to SMARCB1-deficient BAF loss-of-function tumor types. These data present a novel mechanism by which fusion oncoproteins generate BAF complex loss-of-function phenotypes, independent of deleterious subunit mutations.",

Samples were thawed overnight at -20°C, then disrupted using a TissueLyser LT (Qiagen) for 5 minutes at 50 Hz. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer protocol with on-column DNase I (Qiagen) digestion.Cut & Run protocol Cells were harvested following 24-hr exposure to DMSO or 10uM of CMP12 (generous gift of Jun Qi) followed by 24-hr exposure to DMSO plus base media or StemPro Adipogenesis media (ThermoFisher) or 10uM CMP12 plus base media or StemPro Adipogenesis media. CUT&RUN experiments were performed according to established protocols with minor modifications. Briefly, 500K cells per sample were incubated with Concanavalin A-coated beads (Polysciences) for 10 min and then permeabilized with Triton X-100. Cell-bead complexes were then incubated with the indicated antibody for 2 hr at 4°C. Cell-bead complexes were washed and then incubated with pA-MNase for 1 hr at 4°C. Cell-bead complexes were washed and then cooled to ~0°C. pA-MNase was activated by the addition of calcium chloride and incubated for 30 min at ~0°C. The cleavage reaction was quenched with a solution containing spike-in DNA and RNAase A. Cleaved DNA fragments released into solution were then collected and treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and proteinase K (Thermo Scientific). DNA was then isolated using phenol-chloroform. CUT&RUN libraries were prepared with Illumina’s NEBNext Ultra II DNA library Prep Kit with modifications that aim to preserve short fragments.ChIP-seq libraries were prepared with Illumina’s NEBNext Ultra II DNA library Prep Kit using standard protocols. ChIP-seq was sequenced on Illumina Next-seq 500 using 75 bp single-end sequencing parameters.    CUT&RUN libraries were prepared with Illumina’s NEBNext Ultra II DNA library Prep Kit with modifications that aim to preserve short fragments.    ATAC-seq samples were sequenced on Next-seq 500 (Illumina) using 37 bp pair-end sequencing parameters.    RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Nebnext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module and the Nebnext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina using standard protocols.

Spike-in normalization of bigWig files can be incoporated by scaling the bigWig files by the ratio of fly to human reads in the control sample divided by the ratio of fly to human reads in each sample, i.e. (fly / human)_control / (fly / human)_sample. The total number of mapped fly and human reads can be estimated by aligning the fastq files to the hg19 and dm3 genome and then summing the third column (mapped reads) from the samtools idxstats output.",

            "Summary": "Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) is the most frequent high-grade soft tissue sarcoma subtype. It is characterized by a component of undifferentiated tumor cells coexisting with a component of well-differentiated adipocytic tumor cells. Both dedifferentiated (DD) and well-differentiated (WD) components exhibit MDM2 amplification, however their cellular origin remains elusive. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and functional assays in paired WD and DD components from primary DDLPS tumors, we characterized the cellular heterogeneity of DDLPS tumor and micro-environment. We identified a population of tumor adipocyte stem cells (ASC) showing striking similarities with adipocyte stromal progenitors found in white adipose tissue. We show that tumor ASC harbor the ancestral genomic alterations of WD and DD components, suggesting that both derive from these progenitors following clonal evolution. Last, we show that DD tumor cells keep important biological properties of ASC including pluripotency and that their adipogenic properties are inhibited by a TGF-β high immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment.",

Briefly, GCs were resuspended in the master mix and loaded together with partitioning oil and gel beads into the chip to generate the gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM). The poly-A RNA from the cell lysate contained in every single GEM was retrotranscripted to cDNA, which contains an Ilumina R1 primer sequence, Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) and the 10x Barcode. The pooled barcoded cDNA was then cleaned up with Silane DynaBeads, amplified by PCR and the apropiated sized fragments were selected with SPRIselect reagent for subsequent library construction.
