Each sample was assigned to the most abundant cell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows and samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was calculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hypergeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jaccard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could not be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of clusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clusters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using this approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To estimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within each of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were normalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a continuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided t-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in estimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the abundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned to the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the sample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network plots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R package with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between cell states.\n⑦结果：鉴定出三种不同的“肉瘤生态型”(SEs)，每个生态型由四个到十个共表达的细胞状态组成。\n原文：\n(1)Results:Reconstructing STS cellular communities\n\"We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ (SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community.\"\n\n2、生态型的临床、细胞和分子特征分析（Analysis of Clinical, Cellular, and Molecular Characteristics of Ecotypes）\n①分析了每种生态型与临床特征（如患者性别、肿瘤类型）、细胞状态和分子信号传导途径（Hedgehog信号、干扰素信号）的关联。\n原文：\n(1)Results：Reconstructing STS cellular communities\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, cellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 13) \n②\t绘制训练队列SE生物学特征图。每个STS组织分配给每个SE的百分比\n原文：\n(1)Fig. 5 | Characterization of SEs\nPlot of SE biological features in the training cohort.
