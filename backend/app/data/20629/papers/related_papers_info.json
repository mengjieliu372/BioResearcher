The DD component is believed to originate from the WD component by acquiring additional genomic alterations. In this study, we performed multiregion genome, epigenome, and transcriptome analyses of three patients with DDLPS. In two patients, there were few common genomic alterations across all samples, but many common alterations within DD or WD component samples. Phylogenetic trees predicted from the genomic alterations were consistent with those predicted from DNA methylation patterns. The expression patterns of adipogenesis-related genes differed between DD and WD components and also among patients in connection with their CpG island methylation status. These results indicate that in some patients, WD and DD components are evolutionarily separated at very early stages of tumorigenesis, and are formed through relatively long clonal selection with acquisition of different driver genomic alterations and DNA methylation changes.",

It is characterized by a component of undifferentiated tumor cells coexisting with a component of well-differentiated adipocytic tumor cells. Both dedifferentiated (DD) and well-differentiated (WD) components exhibit MDM2 amplification, however their cellular origin remains elusive. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, DNA sequencing, in situ multiplex immunofluorescence and functional assays in paired WD and DD components from primary DDLPS tumors, we characterize the cellular heterogeneity of DDLPS tumor and micro-environment. We identify a population of tumor adipocyte stem cells (ASC) showing striking similarities with adipocyte stromal progenitors found in white adipose tissue. We show that tumor ASC harbor the ancestral genomic alterations of WD and DD components, suggesting that both derive from these progenitors following clonal evolution. Last, we show that DD tumor cells keep important biological properties of ASC including pluripotency and that their adipogenic properties are inhibited by a TGF-β-high immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment.",

            "abstract": "The present study aimed to explore the prognostic value, function, and mechanism of CCNDBP1 in dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL). Immunohistochemistry staining was used to analyze the protein expression of CCNDBP1 in tissue specimens. After silencing CCNDBP1 in LPS853 and overexpressing CCNDBP1 in LPS510, CCK-8, clone formation, transwell migration, and invasion assays were used to detect cell proliferation, migration, and invasion ability. CCNDBP1-induced cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The altered expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins were detected by Western blot. The methylation, gene expression, and clinical data of 58 samples with DDL were analyzed using the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database. Low expression of CCNDBP1 was associated with a poor prognosis of patients with DDL and was considered an independent prognostic factor of the progression-free survival (PFS). CCNDBP1 significantly inhibited the clone formation, proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells in vitro and promoted cancer cell apoptosis. CCNDBP1 could repress the pathological EMT, thereby inhibiting the malignant behaviors of DDL cells. The high degree of DNA methylation sites cg05194114 and cg22184989 could decrease the expression of CCNDBP1 and worsen the prognosis of DDL patients. This is the first study reporting that CCNDBP1 is a tumor suppressor gene of DDL and putative prognostic marker in DDL patients. CCNDBP1 might inhibit the ability of cell proliferation and invasion by repressing pathological EMT, and the expression of CCNDBP1 could be regulated by DNA methylation in DDL.",

Up to now, the prognostic value of BAG1 or BAG2 in LPS has not been defined yet. Expression profiling data of LPS patients were collected from TCGA and GEO database. Survival curves were plotted to verify the outcome differences of patients based on BAG1 or BAG2 expression. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to analyze the prognostic ability of BAG1 or BAG2. Chaperone's regulators BAG1 and BAG2 were identified as prognostic biomarkers for LPS patients, which exhibited distinct expression patterns and survival outcome prediction performances. Patients with high BAG2 expression and/or low BAG1 expression had worse prognosis. Enrichment analysis showed that BAG1 was involved in negative regulation of TGF-β signaling. Low expression of BAG1 was associated with high abundance of regulatory T cells (Tregs). The 2-gene signature model further confirmed the improved risk assessment performance of BAG1 and BAG2: high risk patients displayed poor prognosis.

Well-differentiated (WDLPS) and dedifferentiated (DDLPS) liposarcoma are the most frequent subtypes of RPLPS and present amplified MDM2 gene as a hallmark. However, there are few reports evaluating the role of alternatively spliced MDM2 transcripts in RPLPS. In this study, we assessed MDM2-ALT2 expression levels in a cohort of RPLPS patients and evaluated the biological functions of the MDM2-ALT2 isoform in vitro in DDLPS cell lines. Using BaseScope™ and qPCR, we demonstrated that MDM2-Full Length (MDM2-FL) and MDM2-ALT2 expression levels were upregulated in RPLPS patient-derived tissue samples compared to normal adjacent to tumor tissue (NAT). DDLPS cells overexpressing MDM2-FL or MDM2-ALT2 had higher proliferation rates and increased migration and invasion capacities, as well as increased protein levels of p-AKT, mTOR, p70S6K, MMP2, and cJun. Simultaneous overexpression of MDM2-ALT2 and AKT silencing showed that AKT inhibition impaired p-p70S6K and MMP2 protein increased levels and led to significantly decreased proliferation and migration rates compared to cells overexpressing MDM2-ALT2 only.

            "abstract": "Liposarcoma, the most common soft tissue sarcoma, is a group of fat cell mesenchymal tumors with different histological subtypes. The dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been observed in human cancers including a few studies in sarcoma. However, the global transcriptome analysis and potential role of lncRNAs remain unexplored in liposarcoma. The present investigation uncovers the transcriptomic profile of liposarcoma by RNA sequencing to gain insight into the global transcriptional changes in liposarcoma. Our RNA sequencing analysis has identified that many oncogenic lncRNAs are differentially expressed in different subtypes of liposarcoma including MALAT1, PVT1, SNHG15, LINC00152, and MIR210HG. Importantly, we identified a highly overexpressed, unannotated, and novel lncRNA in dedifferentiated liposarcomas. We have named it TODL, transcript overexpressed in dedifferentiated liposarcoma. TODL lncRNA displayed significantly higher expression in dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell lines and patient samples. Interestingly, functional studies revealed that TODL lncRNA has an oncogenic function in liposarcoma cells by regulating proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, differentiation, and tumorigenesis in the murine model. Silencing of TODL lncRNA highlighted the enrichment of several key oncogenic signaling pathways including cell cycle, transcriptional misregulation, FOXM1 network, p53 signaling, PLK1 signaling, FoxO, and signaling Aurora signaling pathways. RNA pull-down assay revealed the binding of TODL lncRNA with FOXM1, an oncogenic transcription factor, and the key regulator of the cell cycle. Silencing of TODL lncRNA also induces adipogenesis in dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Altogether, our finding indicates that TODL could be utilized as a novel, specific diagnostic biomarker, and a pharmacological target for therapeutic development in controlling aggressive and metastatic dedifferentiated liposarcomas.",

The prognostic significance of histological grading of the dedifferentiated component remains to be elucidated due to vague grading criteria employed in previous studies. Molecular markers of tumor behavior, including amplification levels of murine double minute-2 (MDM2) and cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (CDK4) genes, have been explored in a limited number of cases. Here we investigate whether 'Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer' (FNCLCC) grade and MDM2 gene amplification levels have prognostic value in dedifferentiated liposarcoma in terms of local recurrence and disease-specific survival. Fifty cases were retrieved, reviewed and FNCLCC grade was scored for the dedifferentiated component. Testing for MDM2 gene amplification was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Amplification was categorized as high level (≥20 copies) and as low level (<20 copies). Follow-up data was obtained through chart review. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the effect of grade and level of MDM2 amplification on outcomes. Our series includes 50 patients (male n=28, female n=22) with an average age of 63 years (range, 28-88) and a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 2-120). Tumors were graded as grade 1 (6%), grade 2 (58%), and grade 3 (36%). When adjusted for age, sex, site, tumor size, and margin status, grade 3 patients had a higher recurrence rate than grades 1 and 2 (HR=2.07, 95% CI: 1.24, 7.62; P=0.015). Patients with high-level MDM2 amplification had higher recurrence rate on univariate analysis (P=0.028), but not on multivariate analysis (HR=1.69, 95% CI: 0.73, 3.94; P=0.221). FNCLCC grade 3 dedifferentiation confers a worse prognosis in dedifferentiated liposarcoma in terms of local recurrence.

            "abstract": "<p id=\"Par1\">Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for patients with advanced liposarcoma (LPS), but response rates are only 25% and the overall survival at 5 years is dismal at 20–34%. Translation of other therapies have not been successful and there has been no significant improvement in prognosis for nearly 20 years. The aberrant activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway has been implicated in the aggressive clinical behavior LPS and in resistance to chemotherapy, but the precise mechanism remains elusive and efforts to target AKT clinically have failed. Here we show that the AKT-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription elongation factor IWS1, promotes the maintenance of cancer stem cells in both cell and xenograft models of LPS. In addition, phosphorylation of IWS1 by AKT contributes to a “metastable” cell phenotype, characterized by mesenchymal/epithelial plasticity. The expression of phosphorylated IWS1 also promotes anchorage-dependent and independent growth, cell migration, invasion, and tumor metastasis. In patients with LPS, IWS1 expression is associated with reduced overall survival, increased frequency of recurrence, and shorter time to relapse after resection. These findings indicate that IWS1-mediated transcription elongation is an important regulator of human LPS pathobiology in an AKT-dependent manner and implicate IWS1 as an important molecular target to treat LPS.</p>\n      ",
