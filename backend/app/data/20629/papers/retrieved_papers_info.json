        "abstract": "Dedifferentiated liposarcoma represents a form of liposarcoma composed of a non-lipogenic sarcoma associated with well-differentiated liposarcoma. The prognostic significance of histological grading of the dedifferentiated component remains to be elucidated due to vague grading criteria employed in previous studies. Molecular markers of tumor behavior, including amplification levels of murine double minute-2 (MDM2) and cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (CDK4) genes, have been explored in a limited number of cases. Here we investigate whether 'Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer' (FNCLCC) grade and MDM2 gene amplification levels have prognostic value in dedifferentiated liposarcoma in terms of local recurrence and disease-specific survival. Fifty cases were retrieved, reviewed and FNCLCC grade was scored for the dedifferentiated component. Testing for MDM2 gene amplification was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Amplification was categorized as high level (≥20 copies) and as low level (<20 copies). Follow-up data was obtained through chart review. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the effect of grade and level of MDM2 amplification on outcomes. Our series includes 50 patients (male n=28, female n=22) with an average age of 63 years (range, 28-88) and a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 2-120). Tumors were graded as grade 1 (6%), grade 2 (58%), and grade 3 (36%). When adjusted for age, sex, site, tumor size, and margin status, grade 3 patients had a higher recurrence rate than grades 1 and 2 (HR=2.07, 95% CI: 1.24, 7.62; P=0.015). Patients with high-level MDM2 amplification had higher recurrence rate on univariate analysis (P=0.028), but not on multivariate analysis (HR=1.69, 95% CI: 0.73, 3.94; P=0.221). FNCLCC grade 3 dedifferentiation confers a worse prognosis in dedifferentiated liposarcoma in terms of local recurrence. MDM2 amplification level remains a useful diagnostic tool in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, but has no prognostic value in terms of local recurrence.",

In this review, we focus on emerging studies that describe the key ECM components commonly found in soft tissue sarcomas and discuss preclinical and clinical evidence outlining the important role that these proteins and their cognate adhesion receptors play in sarcomagenesis. We conclude by providing a perspective on the need for more comprehensive in-depth analyses of both the ECM and adhesion receptor biology in multiple histological subtypes in order to identify new drug targets and prognostic biomarkers for this group of rare diseases of unmet need.</p>\n      ",

The DD component is believed to originate from the WD component by acquiring additional genomic alterations. In this study, we performed multiregion genome, epigenome, and transcriptome analyses of three patients with DDLPS. In two patients, there were few common genomic alterations across all samples, but many common alterations within DD or WD component samples. Phylogenetic trees predicted from the genomic alterations were consistent with those predicted from DNA methylation patterns. The expression patterns of adipogenesis-related genes differed between DD and WD components and also among patients in connection with their CpG island methylation status. These results indicate that in some patients, WD and DD components are evolutionarily separated at very early stages of tumorigenesis, and are formed through relatively long clonal selection with acquisition of different driver genomic alterations and DNA methylation changes.",

It is characterized by a component of undifferentiated tumor cells coexisting with a component of well-differentiated adipocytic tumor cells. Both dedifferentiated (DD) and well-differentiated (WD) components exhibit MDM2 amplification, however their cellular origin remains elusive. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, DNA sequencing, in situ multiplex immunofluorescence and functional assays in paired WD and DD components from primary DDLPS tumors, we characterize the cellular heterogeneity of DDLPS tumor and micro-environment. We identify a population of tumor adipocyte stem cells (ASC) showing striking similarities with adipocyte stromal progenitors found in white adipose tissue. We show that tumor ASC harbor the ancestral genomic alterations of WD and DD components, suggesting that both derive from these progenitors following clonal evolution.

T-cell immunotherapies selectively target malignant cells, holding promise against DDLS. The development of successful immunotherapy for DDLS requires a thorough evaluation of the tumor immune microenvironment and the identification and characterization of targetable immunogenic tumor antigens. To assess the complexity of the human DDLS tumor immune microenvironment and to identify target antigens, we used the nCounter NanoString platform, analyzing gene expression profiles across 29 DDLS and 10 healthy adipose tissue samples. Hierarchical clustering of tumors based on expression of tumor inflammation signature genes revealed two distinct groups, consisting of 15 inflamed tumors and 14 non-inflamed tumors, demonstrating tumor heterogeneity within this sarcoma subtype. Among the identified antigens, PBK and TTK exhibited substantial upregulation in mRNA expression compared to healthy adipose tissue controls, further corroborated by positive protein expression by IHC. This data shows considerable inter-tumoral heterogeneity of inflammation, which should be taken into consideration when designing an immunotherapy for DDLS, and provides a novel targetable antigen in DDLS.

        "abstract": "Myxoid liposarcoma with or without a round cell component is the most common subtype of liposarcoma. The diagnosis of myxoid liposarcoma could be challenging with histology, as a variety of soft tissue tumors with myxoid change might mimic myxoid liposarcoma, especially on small biopsy tissues. Chromosomal translocations of t(12,16) (q13;p11) and t(12;22) (q13;q12), rendering gene fusions of DDIT3 (previously CHOP) with FUS and EWSR1, have been found to be characteristic of myxoid liposarcoma, and were identifiable in more than 95% cases. These genetic alterations, therefore, are ideal as molecular markers to facilitate the diagnosis of this type of tumor. DDIT3 (12q13) dual-color break-apart rearrangement probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization has been commercially available. However, its consistency with DDIT3-associated gene fusion and its clinical use, including sensitivity and specificity, have not been adequately evaluated. In this study, we assessed the locus specificity of the probe on metaphase, and then tested it on 8 cases of myxoid liposarcoma, 12 cases of other sarcomas, and 18 cases of tumors with myxoid differentiation. All 8 myxoid liposarcomas showed DDIT3 gene break-apart, whereas all 12 other sarcomas were negative. All the cases with DDIT3 break-apart also showed FUS-DDIT3 fusion by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, with 100% consistency. In addition, the FISH assay has been clinically applied on 18 myxoid tumors with promising outcome. In conclusion, FISH with DDIT3 break-apart probe is a highly sensitive and specific assay for detection of DDIT3-associated gene fusions, and therefore is a valuable adjunct in diagnosis or differential diagnosis of myxoid liposarcoma.",

Survival curves were plotted to verify the outcome differences of patients based on BAG1 or BAG2 expression. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to analyze the prognostic ability of BAG1 or BAG2. Chaperone's regulators BAG1 and BAG2 were identified as prognostic biomarkers for LPS patients, which exhibited distinct expression patterns and survival outcome prediction performances. Patients with high BAG2 expression and/or low BAG1 expression had worse prognosis. Enrichment analysis showed that BAG1 was involved in negative regulation of TGF-β signaling. Low expression of BAG1 was associated with high abundance of regulatory T cells (Tregs). The 2-gene signature model further confirmed the improved risk assessment performance of BAG1 and BAG2: high risk patients displayed poor prognosis.

Immunohistochemistry staining was used to analyze the protein expression of CCNDBP1 in tissue specimens. After silencing CCNDBP1 in LPS853 and overexpressing CCNDBP1 in LPS510, CCK-8, clone formation, transwell migration, and invasion assays were used to detect cell proliferation, migration, and invasion ability. CCNDBP1-induced cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The altered expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins were detected by Western blot. The methylation, gene expression, and clinical data of 58 samples with DDL were analyzed using the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database. Low expression of CCNDBP1 was associated with a poor prognosis of patients with DDL and was considered an independent prognostic factor of the progression-free survival (PFS). CCNDBP1 significantly inhibited the clone formation, proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells in vitro and promoted cancer cell apoptosis. CCNDBP1 could repress the pathological EMT, thereby inhibiting the malignant behaviors of DDL cells. The high degree of DNA methylation sites cg05194114 and cg22184989 could decrease the expression of CCNDBP1 and worsen the prognosis of DDL patients. This is the first study reporting that CCNDBP1 is a tumor suppressor gene of DDL and putative prognostic marker in DDL patients. CCNDBP1 might inhibit the ability of cell proliferation and invasion by repressing pathological EMT, and the expression of CCNDBP1 could be regulated by DNA methylation in DDL.",

Epigenetic elements are key regulators of inflammation; however, their involvement in severe burns has not been studied. In this work, we aimed to unveil the histone H3 posttranslational modifications (PTM) profile and their enrichment in promoters of inflammatory genes in response to severe burns. Methods: The levels of H3 PTMs were analyzed by ELISA assays in circulating cells from burn patients. ChIP assays were conducted to evaluate the enrichment of H3K9me2 and H3S28p at the promoter of CXCL8, IL-17, TNFA, IL-6, FOS, and IL-1B genes. Results: We found that eight H3 PTMs decreased at 5 days post-burn. Burn patients showed a decreased enrichment of H3K9me2 in CXCL8, IL-17, and TNFA promoters, whereas IL-6, FOS, and IL-1B promoters displayed an H3S28p enrichment diminution during the first 10 days post-burn. Interestingly, burn-injured septic patients exhibited an increased enrichment of H3K9me2 in TNFA, IL-1B, CXCL8, and IL-17 promoters, whereas H3S28p was increased in promoters of TNFA and IL-1B at 1 dpb.

        "abstract": "Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma (PRMS) is a rare and highly aggressive sarcoma, occurring mostly in the deep soft tissues of middle-aged adults and showing a variable degree of skeletal muscle differentiation. The diagnosis is challenging as pathologic features overlap with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), malignant Triton tumor, and other pleomorphic sarcomas. As recurrent genetic alterations underlying PRMS have not been described to date, ancillary molecular diagnostic testing is not useful in subclassification. Herein, we perform genomic profiling of a well-characterized cohort of 14 PRMS, compared to a control group of 23 ERMS and other pleomorphic sarcomas (undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma) using clinically validated DNA-targeted Next generation sequencing (NGS) panels (MSK-IMPACT). The PRMS cohort included eight males and six females, with a median age of 53 years (range 31-76 years). Despite similar tumor mutation burdens, the genomic landscape of PRMS, with a high frequency of TP53 (79%) and RB1 (43%) alterations, stood in stark contrast to ERMS, with 4% and 0%, respectively. CDKN2A deletions were more common in PRMS (43%), compared to ERMS (13%). In contrast, ERMS harbored somatic driver mutations in the RAS pathway and loss of function mutations in BCOR, which were absent in PRMS. Copy number variations in PRMS showed multiple chromosomal arm-level changes, most commonly gains of chr17p and chr22q and loss of chr6q. Notably, gain of chr8, commonly seen in ERMS (61%) was conspicuously absent in PRMS. The genomic profiles of other pleomorphic sarcomas were overall analogous to PRMS, showing shared alterations in TP53, RB1, and CDKN2A. Overall survival and progression-free survival of PRMS were significantly worse (p < 0.0005) than that of ERMS. Our findings revealed that the molecular landscape of PRMS aligns with other adult pleomorphic sarcomas and is distinct from that of ERMS. Thus, NGS assays may be applied in select challenging cases toward a refined classification. Finally, our data corroborate the inclusion of PRMS in the therapeutic bracket of pleomorphic sarcomas, given that their clinical outcomes are comparable.",

To validate this, the prognostic significance of MD in a uniformly treated cohort of DDLPS was assessed. A cohort of patients that have been uniformly treated at one institution for DDLPS of the retroperitoneum and pelvis were stained with smooth muscle actin (SMA) and desmin and semiquantitatively scored for staining focality and strength. Clinical and survival data was collected, and the prognostic significance of MD was evaluated. A total of 50 patients with uniformly treated DDLPS were evaluated. SMA (P=0.052) and a combined score of MD (SMA+desmin) showed a statistically significant decrease in 5-year disease-free survival (P=0.002) in univariate analysis and in multivariate testing combined MD trended toward significance (P=0.052). Combined MD was associated with a decreased OS in multivariate analysis (P=0.004). In a uniformly treated cohort of DDLPS stained for myogenic markers, a combined myogenic score was associated with poor overall survival in multivariate analysis.

        "abstract": "<p>Bone metastases are a prevalent complication in advanced cancers, particularly in breast, prostate, and lung cancers, and are associated with severe skeletal-related events (SREs), including fractures, spinal cord compression, and debilitating pain. Conventional bone-targeted treatments like bisphosphonates and RANKL inhibitors (denosumab) reduce osteoclast-mediated bone resorption but do not directly impact tumor progression within the bone. This review focuses on examining the growing potential of immunotherapy in targeting the unique challenges posed by bone metastases. Even though immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly changed cancer treatment, their impact on bone metastases appears limited because of the bone microenvironment’s immunosuppressive traits, which include high levels of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) and the immune-suppressing cells, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). This review underscores the investigation of combined therapeutic approaches that might ease these difficulties, such as the synergy of immune checkpoint inhibitors with agents aimed at bones (denosumab, bisphosphonates), chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, as well as the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with different immunotherapeutic methods, including CAR T-cell therapy. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of preclinical studies and clinical trials that show the synergistic potential of these combination approaches, which aim to both enhance immune responses and mitigate bone destruction. By offering an in-depth exploration of how these strategies can be tailored to the bone microenvironment, this review underscores the need for personalized treatment approaches. The findings emphasize the urgent need for further research into overcoming immune evasion in bone metastases, with the goal of improving patient survival and quality of life.</p>",

An inflammatory component in the pathology of otherwise “primary cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative” disease has recently been recognized and targeted as a means of therapeutic intervention.

These miRNAs are highly expressed in the colon and are consistently reported as being downregulated in colorectal and other cancers. Through regulation of multiple targets, they elicit potent effects on cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis. Importantly, a recent discovery demonstrates that miR-143 and miR-145 are not expressed in colonic epithelial cells; rather, these two miRNAs are highly expressed in mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. The expression patterns of miR-143 and miR-145 and other miRNAs were initially determined from tissue level data without consideration that multiple different cell types, each with their own unique miRNA expression patterns, make up each tissue.

        "abstract": "<p>Soft-tissue sarcomas are a rare group of malignant tumors that usually are treated with surgical excision and radiation therapy, but recently, pazopanib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been used in patients with metastases who do not respond to standard chemotherapy regimens. Based on patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas who had received prior chemotherapy, several clinical studies have reported the survival and sensitivity (approximately 5% to 10% sensitive) of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas treated with pazopanib. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been used to provide a wide genetic information and to develop personalized medicine in cancer treatment. However, there are few reports and no genetic analyses of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas who had a complete response (CR) to pazopanib.</p>\n         <p>We described the clinicopathologic features of a patient with a rare, advanced soft-tissue sarcoma who achieved a CR to pazopanib treatment. Furthermore, integrative analyses using NGS and arrays were performed to elucidate characteristic alterations, including gene mutations, copy number changes, and protein expression that were associated with response to pazopanib. Additionally, functional analyses consisting of in vitro and in vivo assays were also performed to elucidate whether the identified alterations were associated with oncogenic abilities and drug responses.</p>\n         <p>In a sample from a 70-year-old woman with an advanced soft-tissue sarcoma treated for 1 month with 800 mg of oral pazopanib daily, CT scans demonstrated a CR to treatment. To our knowledge, there have been no patients with soft-tissue sarcomas among several clinical trials of pazopanib that have achieved a CR and therefore, our patient is considered to be extremely rare. We performed an integrative analysis including whole-exome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and phosphorylation profiling of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) using tumor samples from a patient with a CR matched to normal samples. From here on we will refer to this patient as having a CR, although a short term high-grade partial response may be more accurate. These analyses were performed using NGS and the phosphoreceptor tyrosine kinase (phospho-RTK) array. As a validation study, we also performed target sequencing using three samples from patients with long-term stable disease and two samples from patients with progressive disease who responded to pazopanib treatment. In addition, characteristic gene alterations that were identified according to the response to pazopanib in one patient with a CR, in three patients with long-term stable disease, and in 27 patients with high-grade soft-tissue sarcomas with different histologic subtypes and different responses to pazopanib were verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We conducted a focus formation assay to evaluate the transforming activities of these genomic alterations.</p>\n         <p>In the patient with a CR to pazopanib, we identified several somatic mutations including Fms related receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (<italic>FLT1</italic>) p.G38S, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (<italic>PDGFRA</italic>) p.T83S, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (<italic>PDGFRB</italic>) exon 13 skipping. Amplification at chromosome 12q13-14 encompassing GLI family zinc finger 1 (<italic>GLI1</italic>) and cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (<italic>CDK4</italic>) was also detected. Furthermore, an elevated PDGFRB phosphorylation level was observed in the tumor. In target sequencing analyses in five patients, one of three patients with long-term stable disease had 12q13-14 amplification. The mRNA expression of <italic>GLI1</italic>, <italic>CDK4</italic>, and pazopanib targets including <italic>PDGFRA</italic>, <italic>PDGFRB</italic>, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)1-3, and stem cell factor receptor (<italic>KIT</italic>) in samples from the patient with a CR, and 27 patients with high-grade soft-tissue sarcomas was verified. The expression of <italic>GLI1</italic> was characteristically increased in the patient with a CR and in those with long-term stable disease relative to other patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. Overexpression of GLI1 showed strong transforming potential in 3T3 cells. Moreover, the overexpression of GLI1 upregulated the expression of the PDGFRB protein and promoted phosphorylation, which was dose-dependently inhibited by pazopanib. However, inhibition of GLI1-induced transformation by pazopanib was limited in the focus formation assay; therefore, mechanisms other than PDGFRB activation may contribute to transformation.</p>\n         <p>We identified several gene alterations that might be associated with a CR and long-term stable disease in patients who received pazopanib for advanced soft-tissue sarcomas. We therefore believe that this distinct molecular profile warrants further investigation to identify predictive biomarkers of the response to pazopanib.</p>\n         <p>Our findings identify molecular mechanisms that possibly explain the high sensitivity of soft-tissue sarcomas to pazopanib and may lead to the development of predictive biomarkers and novel therapies in patients with this and other types of soft-tissue sarcomas.</p>\n        ",

However, we have encountered cases of PLAG1-rearranged uterine sarcomas lacking M-LMS-like morphology and/or any expression of smooth muscle markers. To better characterize their clinicopathologic features, we performed a multiinstitutional search that yielded 11 cases. The patients ranged in age from 34 to 72 years (mean, 57 years). All tumors arose in the uterine corpus, ranging in size from 6.5 to 32 cm (mean, 15 cm). The most common stage at presentation was pT1b (n = 6), and 3 cases had stage pT1 (unspecified), and 1 case each presented in stages pT2a and pT3b. Most were treated only with hysterectomy and adnexectomy. The follow-up (range, 7-71 months; median, 39 months) was available for 7 patients. Three cases (7-21 months of follow-up) had no evidence of disease. Three of the 4 remaining patients died of disease within 55 to 71 months, while peritoneal spread developed in the last patient, and the patient was transferred for palliative care at 39 months. Morphologically, the tumors showed a high intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity. M-LMS-like and epithelioid leiomyosarcoma-like morphology were present in 3 and 5 primary tumors, respectively, the remaining mostly presented as nondescript ovoid or spindle cell sarcomas. Unusual morphologic findings included prominently hyalinized stroma (n = 3), adipocytic differentiation with areas mimicking myxoid liposarcoma (n = 2), osteosarcomatous differentiation (n = 1), and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma-like areas (n = 1). The mitotic activity ranged from 3 to 24 mitoses per 10 high-power fields (mean, 9); 3 of 10 cases showed necrosis. In 3 of 11 cases, no expression of smooth muscle actin, h-caldesmon, or desmin was noted, whereas 5 of 5 cases expressed PLAG1. By RNA sequencing, the following fusion partners were identified: PUM1, CHCHD7 (each n = 2), C15orf29, CD44, MYOCD, FRMD6, PTK2, and TRPS1 (each n = 1). One case only showed PLAG1 gene break by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Our study documents a much broader morphologic spectrum of PLAG1-rearranged uterine sarcomas than previously reported, encompassing but not limited to M-LMS-like morphology with occasional heterologous (particularly adipocytic) differentiation. As it is currently difficult to precisely define their line of differentiation, for the time being, we suggest using a descriptive name \"PLAG1-rearranged uterine sarcoma.\"",

        "abstract": "<p id=\"Par1\">Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare and aggressive thyroid malignancy typically comprised of undifferentiated tumor cells with various histologic morphologies, which makes the diagnosis challenging. These tumors commonly show loss of thyroglobulin and TTF1 with preservation of cytokeratin (67%) and Paired Box Gene 8 (PAX8) (55%) expression. Identification of a sensitive immunohistochemical stain to aid in the diagnosis of ATC would be beneficial. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) against special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2) protein is a sensitive and specific marker expressed in colorectal adenocarcinoma and bone or soft tissue tumors with osteoblastic differentiation. However, SATB2 is also expressed in other sarcomatous/undifferentiated neoplasms lacking osteoblastic differentiation. Using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) we showed that there is variable expression of SATB2 mRNA expression in ATCs. To evaluate the role of SATB2 protein expression in ATC, we performed PAX8, SATB2, pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3 &amp; CAM5.2), claudin-4 and TTF1 immunostaining on 23 cases. ATCs showed retained expression of PAX8 in 65% (15/23); SATB2 was detected in 74% (17/23); pancytokeratin was expressed in 65% (15/23); claudin-4 was expressed in 35% (8/23) and TTF1 showed expression in 13% (3/23) of cases. Furthermore, 83% (5/6) of ATCs which lacked SATB2 expression, retained PAX8 expression, while 88% (7/8) of the tumors without PAX8 expression were positive for SATB2. Differentiated follicular cell-derived thyroid cancers (<italic>n</italic> = 30), differentiated high grade thyroid carcinoma (<italic>n</italic> = 3), and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (<italic>n</italic> = 8) were negative for SATB2 immunoreactivity.

Complete surgical resection remains the mainstay treatment, while the high rate of locoregional recurrence constitutes the predominant cause of mortality. Well-differentiated (WDLPS) and dedifferentiated (DDLPS) liposarcoma are the most frequent subtypes of RPLPS and present amplified MDM2 gene as a hallmark. However, there are few reports evaluating the role of alternatively spliced MDM2 transcripts in RPLPS. In this study, we assessed MDM2-ALT2 expression levels in a cohort of RPLPS patients and evaluated the biological functions of the MDM2-ALT2 isoform in vitro in DDLPS cell lines. Using BaseScope™ and qPCR, we demonstrated that MDM2-Full Length (MDM2-FL) and MDM2-ALT2 expression levels were upregulated in RPLPS patient-derived tissue samples compared to normal adjacent to tumor tissue (NAT). DDLPS cells overexpressing MDM2-FL or MDM2-ALT2 had higher proliferation rates and increased migration and invasion capacities, as well as increased protein levels of p-AKT, mTOR, p70S6K, MMP2, and cJun. Simultaneous overexpression of MDM2-ALT2 and AKT silencing showed that AKT inhibition impaired p-p70S6K and MMP2 protein increased levels and led to significantly decreased proliferation and migration rates compared to cells overexpressing MDM2-ALT2 only. Taken together, our data suggest that MDM2-ALT2 may promote RPLPS progression.</p>",

Translation of other therapies have not been successful and there has been no significant improvement in prognosis for nearly 20 years. The aberrant activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway has been implicated in the aggressive clinical behavior LPS and in resistance to chemotherapy, but the precise mechanism remains elusive and efforts to target AKT clinically have failed. Here we show that the AKT-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription elongation factor IWS1, promotes the maintenance of cancer stem cells in both cell and xenograft models of LPS. In addition, phosphorylation of IWS1 by AKT contributes to a “metastable” cell phenotype, characterized by mesenchymal/epithelial plasticity. The expression of phosphorylated IWS1 also promotes anchorage-dependent and independent growth, cell migration, invasion, and tumor metastasis. In patients with LPS, IWS1 expression is associated with reduced overall survival, increased frequency of recurrence, and shorter time to relapse after resection. These findings indicate that IWS1-mediated transcription elongation is an important regulator of human LPS pathobiology in an AKT-dependent manner and implicate IWS1 as an important molecular target to treat LPS.</p>\n      ",

        "abstract": "Liposarcoma, the most common soft tissue sarcoma, is a group of fat cell mesenchymal tumors with different histological subtypes. The dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been observed in human cancers including a few studies in sarcoma. However, the global transcriptome analysis and potential role of lncRNAs remain unexplored in liposarcoma. The present investigation uncovers the transcriptomic profile of liposarcoma by RNA sequencing to gain insight into the global transcriptional changes in liposarcoma. Our RNA sequencing analysis has identified that many oncogenic lncRNAs are differentially expressed in different subtypes of liposarcoma including MALAT1, PVT1, SNHG15, LINC00152, and MIR210HG. Importantly, we identified a highly overexpressed, unannotated, and novel lncRNA in dedifferentiated liposarcomas. We have named it TODL, transcript overexpressed in dedifferentiated liposarcoma. TODL lncRNA displayed significantly higher expression in dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell lines and patient samples. Interestingly, functional studies revealed that TODL lncRNA has an oncogenic function in liposarcoma cells by regulating proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, differentiation, and tumorigenesis in the murine model. Silencing of TODL lncRNA highlighted the enrichment of several key oncogenic signaling pathways including cell cycle, transcriptional misregulation, FOXM1 network, p53 signaling, PLK1 signaling, FoxO, and signaling Aurora signaling pathways. RNA pull-down assay revealed the binding of TODL lncRNA with FOXM1, an oncogenic transcription factor, and the key regulator of the cell cycle. Silencing of TODL lncRNA also induces adipogenesis in dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Altogether, our finding indicates that TODL could be utilized as a novel, specific diagnostic biomarker, and a pharmacological target for therapeutic development in controlling aggressive and metastatic dedifferentiated liposarcomas.",

Our data underscore the importance of early intervention, before 5–6 weeks of pregnancy, in improving embryonic development, and AMPK is an amiable target for suppressing excessive fibrogenesis in MO embryos to assist increasing populations of obese mothers having healthy children.</p> <p>This work was funded by <funding-source id=\"gs1\"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type=\"doi\">10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> Grant R01HD067449.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>Uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS), or malignant mixed Müllerian tumor, is a cancer that include both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components, resembling endometrial carcinoma. A 55-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. Gross examination of the specimen revealed brittle tissue in the fundus and the left wall of the endometrium. Postoperative pathology revealed a mixture of well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma and osteosarcoma. The patient was never given birth, which may be relevant to the diagnosis. Literature review suggests that being nulliparous may be a significant risk factor for developing uterine carcinosarcoma.</p> <p>In December 2023, a 55-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. Hysteroscopic surgery was performed, and the postoperative pathology showed endometrial cancer accompanied by ossified tissue with necrosis. The immunohistochemical results indicated positive Estrogen receptors (ER), positive Progesterone receptors (PR), ki67 positivity at 70%, negative PTEN, mutated positive p53, focal positive Pax-8, positive SATB2, positive Cytokeratin 7 (CK7), positive EMA and positive Vimentin (Vim). The patient was diagnosed with Uterine carcinosarcoma. On December 18, 2023, the patient underwent partial vaginal resection, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection, and a sub-extensive laparoscopic hysterectomy. Postoperatively, the patients received radiotherapy and four cycles of chemotherapy in the DC regimen. As of July 2024, laboratory and impact test results showed no tumor recurrence. The patient’s disease-free survival (DFS) was seven months.</p> <p>The rate of childless in patients with uterine carcinosarcoma is at a high level.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p id=\"Par1\">In the last decades the survival of metastatic gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients could have been significantly extended due to the introduction of targeted- and immunotherapy. However, only the minority of patients will experience long-lasting survival. Hence, novel therapeutics are clearly necessary for GI cancer patients. Molecular high-throughput profiling techniques have revealed potential novel targetable molecular alterations, emphasizing the necessity for tailored therapeutic approaches. Nuclear export proteins, particularly Exportin-1 (XPO1), have emerged as promising targets in cancer therapy due to their crucial role in cellular homeostasis and regulation of key cellular functions. Dysregulation of XPO1-mediated nuclear export leads to the functional loss of tumor suppressors and pro-apoptotic factors, facilitating cancer progression. Selinexor, a XPO1 inhibitor, has shown promising activity in preclinical and clinical studies, particularly in hematological malignancies. However, its efficacy in GI cancers remains underexplored. This review aims to elucidate the functional and pathophysiological role of XPO1 in GI cancers. Despite the potential of XPO1 inhibitors in suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis, comprehensive molecular landscape data and validation of selective inhibitors in GI cancers are lacking. Targeting XPO1 presents a significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of GI cancer patients. Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the molecular landscape according to XPO1 expression in GI tumors and to validate the efficacy of selective XPO1 inhibitors. These efforts are expected to contribute to the development of more effective and personalized therapeutic strategies for GI cancer patients.</p>",
