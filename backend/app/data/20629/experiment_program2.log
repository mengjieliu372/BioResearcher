Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported.  To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays.  High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.

The two most frequent subtypes well differentiated (WD) and dedifferentiated (DD) LPS are often marked with the giant chromosome and the amplifications of chromosome 12q13-15.

Here, we reported a comprehensive molecular characterization of both tumor and normal tissues from the same batch of LPS patients, including Hi-C, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and WGS datasets. We identified a library of tumor-specific enhancers that may play a critical role in oncogenesis. We also demonstrated the enhancer co-amplification and hijacking events involved with proto-oncogenes such as MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2, which have not been previously reported and as a novel mechanism to upregulate these genes. By combining Hi-C, optical mapping, Nanopore long reads and WGS data, we partially resolved complex structure variations (SVs) and reconstructed the local genome and the giant chromosome. We further validated the presence of multiple copies of  MDM2 and CDK4 are located on the giant chromosome by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

Each pair of patient samples contains one tumor tissue and one matched peritumoral tissue as control. To profile the transcribed regions and to reveal the differential transcriptomes between tumors and peritumoral tissues, we performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) in all patient samples and cell lines. In 4 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples (P241, P298, P69 and P209) and 1 DD-LPS cell line (Lipo863B), we performed 1) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA-seq (ChIP-seq) for histone modifications H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), to chart the open chromatin regions and DD-LPS-specific regulatory elements, such as enhancers; 2) Hi-C experiments to study high-order chromatin structure and link distal enhancers to their target genes; 3) whole genome sequencing (WGS) to profile CNVs and dissect genome rearrangements. To better reveal the sequence details of genome rearrangements, we performed Nanopore long-read sequencing and BioNano optical mapping in Lipo863B cells to help assemble the rearranged regions.

Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}}}\n[END]  \n\nResearch Objective: Experiment24\nPrognostic and Gene Expression Differences between Well-Differentiated and Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma  \nResearch Conditions: Available Resources: Frozen samples, sarcoma cell lines, and paraffin sections.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported.  To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays.  High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.  The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS. Additional studies in diverse sarcoma subtypes will be essential to confirm and expand upon these findings.', 'Overall design': 'To decipher the mechanism of action of PRMT5 inhibition in STS cell lines, four sarcoma cell lines (the IB111, IB114, IB115, and IB128 cells) were untreated or treated with GSK595 at IC80 every 3 days for 10 days and RNA were analyzed by Nanostring assay using an nCounter Metabolic Pathways Panel in the nCounter Max Analyzer.', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL31904, NanoString  nCounter Human  Metabolic Pathways Panel [Gene Symbol version]', 'Samples': {'GSM7795419': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM7795419', 'name': 'IB111 cell line, Control, rep1', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM7795419_20211109_31020962105_run2_IB111_n1_ctl_07.RCC.gz', 'file_size': '8.7 Kb', 'file_type': 'RCC', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM7795419&format=file&file=GSM7795419%5F20211109%5F31020962105%5Frun2%5FIB111%5Fn1%5Fctl%5F07%2ERCC%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 25, 2023', 'Title': 'IB111 cell line, Control, rep1', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell type: dedifferentiated liposarcoma', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were untreated or treated with GSK595 at their respective IC80 every 3 days for 10 days', 'Growth protocol': 'Cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 GlutaMAX Supplement in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen).

The two most frequent subtypes well differentiated (WD) and dedifferentiated (DD) LPS are often marked with the giant chromosome and the amplifications of chromosome 12q13-15. However, it remains unknown how this genomic aberrancy contributes to the dysregulation of the oncogenes. Here, we reported a comprehensive molecular characterization of both tumor and normal tissues from the same batch of LPS patients, including Hi-C, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and WGS datasets. We identified a library of tumor-specific enhancers that may play a critical role in oncogenesis. We also demonstrated the enhancer co-amplification and hijacking events involved with proto-oncogenes such as MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2, which have not been previously reported and as a novel mechanism to upregulate these genes. By combining Hi-C, optical mapping, Nanopore long reads and WGS data, we partially resolved complex structure variations (SVs) and reconstructed the local genome and the giant chromosome. We further validated the presence of multiple copies of  MDM2 and CDK4 are located on the giant chromosome by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

Each pair of patient samples contains one tumor tissue and one matched peritumoral tissue as control. To profile the transcribed regions and to reveal the differential transcriptomes between tumors and peritumoral tissues, we performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) in all patient samples and cell lines. In 4 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples (P241, P298, P69 and P209) and 1 DD-LPS cell line (Lipo863B), we performed 1) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA-seq (ChIP-seq) for histone modifications H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), to chart the open chromatin regions and DD-LPS-specific regulatory elements, such as enhancers; 2) Hi-C experiments to study high-order chromatin structure and link distal enhancers to their target genes; 3) whole genome sequencing (WGS) to profile CNVs and dissect genome rearrangements. To better reveal the sequence details of genome rearrangements, we performed Nanopore long-read sequencing and BioNano optical mapping in Lipo863B cells to help assemble the rearranged regions.

Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}}}\n[END]  \n\nResearch Objective: Experiment24\nPrognostic and Gene Expression Differences between Well-Differentiated and Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma  \nResearch Conditions: Available Resources: Frozen samples, sarcoma cell lines, and paraffin sections.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint.

To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported.  To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays.  High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.  The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS. Additional studies in diverse sarcoma subtypes will be essential to confirm and expand upon these findings.', 'Overall design': 'To decipher the mechanism of action of PRMT5 inhibition in STS cell lines, four sarcoma cell lines (the IB111, IB114, IB115, and IB128 cells) were untreated or treated with GSK595 at IC80 every 3 days for 10 days and RNA were analyzed by Nanostring assay using an nCounter Metabolic Pathways Panel in the nCounter Max Analyzer.', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL31904, NanoString  nCounter Human  Metabolic Pathways Panel [Gene Symbol version]', 'Samples': {'GSM7795419': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM7795419', 'name': 'IB111 cell line, Control, rep1', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM7795419_20211109_31020962105_run2_IB111_n1_ctl_07.RCC.gz', 'file_size': '8.7 Kb', 'file_type': 'RCC', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM7795419&format=file&file=GSM7795419%5F20211109%5F31020962105%5Frun2%5FIB111%5Fn1%5Fctl%5F07%2ERCC%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 25, 2023', 'Title': 'IB111 cell line, Control, rep1', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell type: dedifferentiated liposarcoma', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were untreated or treated with GSK595 at their respective IC80 every 3 days for 10 days', 'Growth protocol': 'Cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 GlutaMAX Supplement in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen).

Here, we reported a comprehensive molecular characterization of both tumor and normal tissues from the same batch of LPS patients, including Hi-C, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and WGS datasets. We identified a library of tumor-specific enhancers that may play a critical role in oncogenesis. We also demonstrated the enhancer co-amplification and hijacking events involved with proto-oncogenes such as MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2, which have not been previously reported and as a novel mechanism to upregulate these genes. By combining Hi-C, optical mapping, Nanopore long reads and WGS data, we partially resolved complex structure variations (SVs) and reconstructed the local genome and the giant chromosome.

In 4 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples (P241, P298, P69 and P209) and 1 DD-LPS cell line (Lipo863B), we performed 1) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA-seq (ChIP-seq) for histone modifications H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), to chart the open chromatin regions and DD-LPS-specific regulatory elements, such as enhancers; 2) Hi-C experiments to study high-order chromatin structure and link distal enhancers to their target genes; 3) whole genome sequencing (WGS) to profile CNVs and dissect genome rearrangements. To better reveal the sequence details of genome rearrangements, we performed Nanopore long-read sequencing and BioNano optical mapping in Lipo863B cells to help assemble the rearranged regions.

Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}}}\n[END]  \n\nResearch Objective: Experiment24\nPrognostic and Gene Expression Differences between Well-Differentiated and Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma  \nResearch Conditions: Available Resources: Frozen samples, sarcoma cell lines, and paraffin sections.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported.  To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays.  High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.

The two most frequent subtypes well differentiated (WD) and dedifferentiated (DD) LPS are often marked with the giant chromosome and the amplifications of chromosome 12q13-15.

Here, we reported a comprehensive molecular characterization of both tumor and normal tissues from the same batch of LPS patients, including Hi-C, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and WGS datasets. We identified a library of tumor-specific enhancers that may play a critical role in oncogenesis. We also demonstrated the enhancer co-amplification and hijacking events involved with proto-oncogenes such as MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2, which have not been previously reported and as a novel mechanism to upregulate these genes. By combining Hi-C, optical mapping, Nanopore long reads and WGS data, we partially resolved complex structure variations (SVs) and reconstructed the local genome and the giant chromosome. We further validated the presence of multiple copies of  MDM2 and CDK4 are located on the giant chromosome by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

Each pair of patient samples contains one tumor tissue and one matched peritumoral tissue as control. To profile the transcribed regions and to reveal the differential transcriptomes between tumors and peritumoral tissues, we performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) in all patient samples and cell lines. In 4 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples (P241, P298, P69 and P209) and 1 DD-LPS cell line (Lipo863B), we performed 1) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA-seq (ChIP-seq) for histone modifications H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), to chart the open chromatin regions and DD-LPS-specific regulatory elements, such as enhancers; 2) Hi-C experiments to study high-order chromatin structure and link distal enhancers to their target genes; 3) whole genome sequencing (WGS) to profile CNVs and dissect genome rearrangements. To better reveal the sequence details of genome rearrangements, we performed Nanopore long-read sequencing and BioNano optical mapping in Lipo863B cells to help assemble the rearranged regions.

Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}}}\n[END]  \n\nResearch Objective: Experiment24\nPrognostic and Gene Expression Differences between Well-Differentiated and Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma  \nResearch Conditions: Available Resources: Frozen samples, sarcoma cell lines, and paraffin sections.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint.

We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays.  High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.  The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS. Additional studies in diverse sarcoma subtypes will be essential to confirm and expand upon these findings.', 'Overall design': 'To decipher the mechanism of action of PRMT5 inhibition in STS cell lines, four sarcoma cell lines (the IB111, IB114, IB115, and IB128 cells) were untreated or treated with GSK595 at IC80 every 3 days for 10 days and RNA were analyzed by Nanostring assay using an nCounter Metabolic Pathways Panel in the nCounter Max Analyzer.', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL31904, NanoString  nCounter Human  Metabolic Pathways Panel [Gene Symbol version]', 'Samples': {'GSM7795419': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM7795419', 'name': 'IB111 cell line, Control, rep1', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM7795419_20211109_31020962105_run2_IB111_n1_ctl_07.RCC.gz', 'file_size': '8.7 Kb', 'file_type': 'RCC', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM7795419&format=file&file=GSM7795419%5F20211109%5F31020962105%5Frun2%5FIB111%5Fn1%5Fctl%5F07%2ERCC%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 25, 2023', 'Title': 'IB111 cell line, Control, rep1', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell type: dedifferentiated liposarcoma', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were untreated or treated with GSK595 at their respective IC80 every 3 days for 10 days', 'Growth protocol': 'Cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 GlutaMAX Supplement in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen).

The two most frequent subtypes well differentiated (WD) and dedifferentiated (DD) LPS are often marked with the giant chromosome and the amplifications of chromosome 12q13-15. However, it remains unknown how this genomic aberrancy contributes to the dysregulation of the oncogenes. Here, we reported a comprehensive molecular characterization of both tumor and normal tissues from the same batch of LPS patients, including Hi-C, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and WGS datasets. We identified a library of tumor-specific enhancers that may play a critical role in oncogenesis. We also demonstrated the enhancer co-amplification and hijacking events involved with proto-oncogenes such as MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2, which have not been previously reported and as a novel mechanism to upregulate these genes. By combining Hi-C, optical mapping, Nanopore long reads and WGS data, we partially resolved complex structure variations (SVs) and reconstructed the local genome and the giant chromosome. We further validated the presence of multiple copies of  MDM2 and CDK4 are located on the giant chromosome by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

Each pair of patient samples contains one tumor tissue and one matched peritumoral tissue as control. To profile the transcribed regions and to reveal the differential transcriptomes between tumors and peritumoral tissues, we performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) in all patient samples and cell lines. In 4 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples (P241, P298, P69 and P209) and 1 DD-LPS cell line (Lipo863B), we performed 1) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA-seq (ChIP-seq) for histone modifications H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), to chart the open chromatin regions and DD-LPS-specific regulatory elements, such as enhancers; 2) Hi-C experiments to study high-order chromatin structure and link distal enhancers to their target genes; 3) whole genome sequencing (WGS) to profile CNVs and dissect genome rearrangements. To better reveal the sequence details of genome rearrangements, we performed Nanopore long-read sequencing and BioNano optical mapping in Lipo863B cells to help assemble the rearranged regions.

Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}}}\n[END]  \n\nResearch Objective: Experiment24\nPrognostic and Gene Expression Differences between Well-Differentiated and Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma  \nResearch Conditions: Available Resources: Frozen samples, sarcoma cell lines, and paraffin sections.
