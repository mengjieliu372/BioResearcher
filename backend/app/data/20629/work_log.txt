In this retrospective study, we correlated molecular findings with histomorphology of 14 myofibroblastic lesions harboring such genetic changes identified by NGS. We additionally performed DNA methylation profiling (DNAmp) and immunohistochemistry. Lesions were from 10 males and 4 females with a mean age of 3 years (range, 0.3 -14) and occurred subcutaneously in the upper limbs (n = 5), lower limbs (n = 3), back/thorax (n = 5), and the nasal cavity (n = 1). Eleven were cured by surgery, including one relapsed case. Two patients were lost to follow-up. One case was very recent, and the patient was biopsied. Histologically, the lesions showed a wide spectrum varying from classic FHI (n=9) to IFS (n=1) or lipofibromatosis-like tumors (LFT) (n=2) or dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-like (DFSP) (n=1) to a predominantly-myxoid spindle cell lesion (n=1). Immunohistochemically, all neoplasms stained with CD34, while S100 was positive in 2/14. EGFR expression was observed in 9/10 cases. Molecularly, the IFS and one LFT harbored EGFR-KDD, while an exon 20 mutation was identified in all FHI, one LFT and in the DFSP and predominantly myxoid spindle cell lesion. By DNAmp, all but two cases formed a well-defined cluster, demonstrating that these lesions are also epigenetically related. In conclusion, EGFR kinase domain aberrations found in FHI, IFS, LFN, DFSP and a spindle cell lesion with a predominant myxoid stroma of children and adolescents show that these neoplasms with a broad morphological spectrum belong to the group of protein kinase-related lesions with a distinct epigenetic signature.

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

Adenosine to Inosine (A-to-I) editingin thetRNA anticodon stem loop is an important modification that influences anticodon-codon recognition.However,the implications of tRNA editing in cancer and its potential for diagnostic and therapeutic applicationsare not yet well understood.We showed that the ADAT2/3 enzyme complex, responsible for this modification in humans, is amplified and overexpressed in several tumor types,with a higher amplification rate in sarcoma tumors, particularly liposarcomas. We determine that the ADAT complex works as an oncogene in these tumors and that its inhibition reduces tumor growth, offering a new approach to cancer treatment. In addition, we provided insight into the mechanisms of cancer development and progression, demonstrating that tRNA editing is required for higher mRNA translation of oncogenic proteins enriched with specific ADAT-sensitive codons. Thus, ADAT-mediated tRNA modification drives oncogenic transformation by remodeling the set of mRNAs being actively translated to increase expression of proteins that promote proliferation.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing and functional assays in paired WD and DD components from primary DDLPS tumors, we characterized the cellular heterogeneity of DDLPS tumor and micro-environment. We identified a population of tumor adipocyte stem cells (ASC) showing striking similarities with adipocyte stromal progenitors found in white adipose tissue.

By coordinating a first-in-kind phase II clinical trial of the CDK4/6i abemaciclib for patients with progressive dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS) with cellular studies to identify the molecular basis of geroconversion, we have defined how therapy induced senescence contributes to disease management.  Thirty patients with progressing DDLS enrolled in the clinical trial and were treated with 200mg abemaciclib twice daily.  The median progression free survival was 33 weeks at the time of the data lock, with 23 of 30 progression-free at 12 weeks (76.7%, two-sided 95% CI 57.7% - 90.1%).  ANGPTL4 is a necessary late regulator of geroconversion, the pathway from reversible cell cycle exit to a stably arrested inflammation-provoking senescent cell, in liposarcoma cell lines treated with CDK4/6i.  Using ANGPTL4 and CDKN2A expression, we were able to identify patients in which abemaciclib induced tumor cell senescence. We were then able to correlate this with outcomes. Senesence correlated with increased leukocyte infiltration, primarily CD4-positive cells, within a month of therapy, and possibly with an improved initial response to abemaciclib.  However, those individuals with both senescence and increased TILs were also more likely to acquire resistance after six months of therapy.  This suggests that combining senolytics with abemaciclib in a subset of patients may improve the durability of patient responses to this class of compounds.', 'Overall design': 'Two to three independent biological replicates of genetically engineered LS8817 cells were made to arrest in quiescence following doxyxyline and palbociclib treatment and  released from this arrest to progress synchronously into senesecence.

We mapped native iMs in two different human cell lines and recovered C-rich sequences that were confirmed to fold into iMs in vitro. We found that iMs in cells are mainly present at actively transcribing gene promoters and that their abundance and distribution are specific to each cell type. iMs with both long and short C-tracts were recovered, further extending the relevance of iMs throughout the genome. By simultaneously mapping G-quadruplexes (G4s), four-stranded structures that form at guanine-rich regions, and comparing the results with iMs, we proved that the two structures can form in independent genomic regions; however, when both iMs and G4s are present in the same genomic tract, their formation is favored.

The two most frequent subtypes well differentiated (WD) and dedifferentiated (DD) LPS are often marked with the giant chromosome and the amplifications of chromosome 12q13-15. However, it remains unknown how this genomic aberrancy contributes to the dysregulation of the oncogenes. Here, we reported a comprehensive molecular characterization of both tumor and normal tissues from the same batch of LPS patients, including Hi-C, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and WGS datasets. We identified a library of tumor-specific enhancers that may play a critical role in oncogenesis. We also demonstrated the enhancer co-amplification and hijacking events involved with proto-oncogenes such as MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2, which have not been previously reported and as a novel mechanism to upregulate these genes. By combining Hi-C, optical mapping, Nanopore long reads and WGS data, we partially resolved complex structure variations (SVs) and reconstructed the local genome and the giant chromosome. We further validated the presence of multiple copies of  MDM2 and CDK4 are located on the giant chromosome by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Consequently, this study provides a comprehensive resource for further research in LPS.', 'Overall design': 'We started with 5 pairs of WD-LPS, 14 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples, and 1 DD-LPS cell line. Each pair of patient samples contains one tumor tissue and one matched peritumoral tissue as control. To profile the transcribed regions and to reveal the differential transcriptomes between tumors and peritumoral tissues, we performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) in all patient samples and cell lines. In 4 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples (P241, P298, P69 and P209) and 1 DD-LPS cell line (Lipo863B), we performed 1) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA-seq (ChIP-seq) for histone modifications H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), to chart the open chromatin regions and DD-LPS-specific regulatory elements, such as enhancers; 2) Hi-C experiments to study high-order chromatin structure and link distal enhancers to their target genes; 3) whole genome sequencing (WGS) to profile CNVs and dissect genome rearrangements. To better reveal the sequence details of genome rearrangements, we performed Nanopore long-read sequencing and BioNano optical mapping in Lipo863B cells to help assemble the rearranged regions.

In 2000, Perou and colleagues demonstrated that tumor phenotypic diversity correlates with differences in global gene expression patterns, which in turn reflect aspects of the biological behavior of the tumors. Gene expression profiling has distinguished sporadic breast tumor sub-classes with genetic, histopathological and clinical differences, however, little is known about the molecular classification of hereditary breast tumors. It has been recently suggested that most tumors arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers display a basal-like phenotype, with the percentages reported in different studies ranging from 44 to almost 100%. In the present study we used expression profiling to produce a molecular classification of BRCA1-associated breast tumors and applied an integrative approach to examine biological dependencies or differences.Methods and Findings: We used frozen tumor tissue from fourteen patients all of which harbored germline pathological mutations in BRCA1. Total RNA extraction, amplification and labeling with Cy5 were performed using standard protocols. Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene) was used as a reference and labeled with Cy3. Each pair of Cy3/Cy5 samples was hybridized onto the CNIO human OncoChip V2, which consists of a spotted microarray with 11,675 cDNA clones from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium. Two channel ratios (Cy5/Cy3) for each spot were generated and quantified using GenePix Pro 5.1 (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA, USA). Data were normalized and filtered and multiple statistical analyses were performed. The data are deposited in the GEO database under the accession number GSE12350. A tissue microarray (TMA) containing an independent series of 15 BRCA1 tumors was used to validate some of the results obtained.We have described molecular signatures that define BRCA1 subclasses depending on the expression of the gene encoding for Estrogen Receptor, ESR1. Signatures were found to be molecularly associated with different biological processes and transcriptional regulatory programs. The signature of ESR1-positive tumors was mainly linked to cell proliferation-related processes and, therefore, regulated by the estrogen receptor, while the signature of ESR1-negative tumors was mainly linked to the immune response and possibly regulated by transcription factors of the REL/NFκB family. These signatures were then verified in an independent series of hereditary and sporadic breast tumors, which revealed a possible prognostic value for each subclass. Over-expression of immune response genes appears to be a common feature of ER-negative sporadic and hereditary breast cancer and is associated with good prognosis. Interestingly, the ESR1-negative tumors were sub-stratified into two groups presenting light differences in the magnitude of the expression of immune response transcripts and REL/NFκB transcription factors, and this could be dependent on the type of germline alteration. In addition, analysis of the human protein-protein interaction network provides the wiring diagram of critical molecular associations in BRCA1 tumorigenesis and identifies close relationships between the different signatures. Conclusions: In summary, in the present study we have established the gene expression profiling of a series of BRCA1 tumors and found that there is a further degree of heterogeneity beyond the main classification by the expression of ESR1 and the presence or absence of a basal-like phenotype. We have identified specific signatures for ESR1-positive and ESR1-negative BRCA1 tumors, the latter characterized by the enrichment of immune response and cell cycle genes, and have found that slight differences in the level of expression of the immune response stratify the ESR1-negative BRCA1 tumors into two additional sub-groups (A and B) with possible prognostic differences. NFkB could be a major driver responsible for the levels of both immune response and apoptotic genes in this group of tumors, which could in turn be related to the type of germline mutation in BRCA1. This study reveals the molecular complexity of BRCA1 breast tumors, which are found to display similarities to sporadic tumors, and suggests possible prognostic implications.', 'Overall design': '14 samples (primary breast tumors containing a BRCA1 mutation) were hybridized to a cDNA microarray in order to investigate the possible heterogeneity within the BRCA1 group.', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL5645, CNIO Human Oncochip 2.0', 'Samples': {'GSM310290': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM310290', 'name': 'BRCA1 primary tumor_02T144', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM310290.gpr.gz', 'file_size': '2.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'GPR', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM310290&format=file&file=GSM310290%2Egpr%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Oct 14, 2009', 'Title': 'BRCA1 primary tumor_02T144', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'Collection of RNA pooled from ten cell lines (adenocarcinoma, mammary gland hepatoblastoma, liver adenocarcinoma, cervix embryonal carcinoma, testis glioblastoma, brain melanoma liposarcoma histiocytic lymphoma; macrophase; histocyte lymphoblastic leukemia plasmacytoma; myeloma; B lymphocyte)Control', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': "Total RNA was extracted using Trizol following manufacturer's instructions.", 'Description': 'Gene expression analysis of primary breast tumor that contains BRCA1 mutation', 'Data processing': 'The data were normalized using default values of GEPAS 4.0 (within-array correction, print-tip lowess).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL5645'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE12350_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '33.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of GPR)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE12350&format=file'}], 'search_query': 'liposarcoma AND prognostic factors'}, 'GPL96': {'Status': 'Public on Mar 11, 2002', 'Title': '[HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'search_query': 'liposarcoma AND prognostic factors'}}}
