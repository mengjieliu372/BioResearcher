        "Reason": "Quantitative PCR is critical for assessing gene expression levels, which is a key aspect of your research objective to compare expression differences.",
        "Suggestions": "Adopt the qPCR setup and analysis methods, ensuring to select primers for genes relevant to your study of liposarcoma. Include GAPDH as a reference gene if applicable. Specify how to correlate the expression levels with clinical outcomes using the data obtained from your research, and ensure statistical methods are appropriate for your analysis."
    },
    "Part 6": {
        "Title": "Western Blot",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "This section provides valuable insights into protein expression analysis, which could complement your gene expression studies. However, it may not be a primary focus unless you specifically plan to analyze protein levels.",
        "Suggestions": "Use this section as a reference if you decide to include protein level analysis in your study. Select antibodies that are relevant to the proteins of interest in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Discuss the expected outcomes and how they will be statistically analyzed to ensure robustness in your findings."
    },
    "Part 7": {
        "Title": "Cell Transfection",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "Cell transfection is relevant if you plan to manipulate gene expression in your cell lines, but may not be essential for your current research objective focused on expression differences.",
        "Suggestions": "Consider using the transfection methods if you decide to conduct functional assays on specific genes. Modify the focus to include genes of interest in your comparison of liposarcoma types. Clearly outline the ethical implications of conducting transfection studies, particularly regarding genetic modifications."

    "Part 8": {
        "Title": "Cell Clone Formation and CCK-8 Assays",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "These assays are important for assessing cell proliferation, an aspect that may be relevant depending on the functional outcomes you wish to explore in your liposarcoma study.",
        "Suggestions": "Use these assays to investigate the impact of gene expression differences on cell proliferation. Adjust the experimental conditions to include your specific cell lines and assess the proliferation rates over a suitable time frame. Discuss how these findings may correlate with clinical outcomes and their implications for prognosis."

    "Part 9": {
        "Title": "Transwell Assays",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "Transwell assays can provide insights into cell migration and invasion, which may be relevant depending on the aspects of liposarcoma progression you wish to study.",
        "Suggestions": "If your research includes studying metastatic behavior, adopt these methods. Adjust the experimental design to focus on the differences in migration and invasion between well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma cells. Discuss potential ethical concerns regarding the use of animal models for migration and invasion studies."
