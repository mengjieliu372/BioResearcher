    "Part 2": {
        "Title": "Pathology Review",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "The pathology review is significant for confirming the diagnosis of DDLPS. While your study focuses on gene expression differences, understanding the pathological features will provide context for your findings. However, your study may not require such extensive pathological evaluation if samples are already confirmed.",
        "Suggestions": "You may refer to the histological evaluation methods and diagnostic criteria used to confirm DDLPS. Modifications might include focusing on the specific characteristics that differentiate WDLPS from DDLPS in your analysis. Additionally, consider discussing how pathology results will be integrated into the broader analysis of gene expression and clinical outcomes, thus providing a clearer framework for interpreting the data."
    },
    "Part 3": {
        "Title": "Whole-Exome Sequencing Analysis",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "The methodologies for whole-exome sequencing (WES) are directly relevant to your research objective of exploring gene expression differences. The detailed steps for library preparation, sequencing, and mutation detection are essential for generating genomic data.",
        "Suggestions": "You can implement the sequencing library preparation protocols and quality control measures described. Consider using the same software tools for variant calling and mutation significance analysis (MuTect2, BWA-MEM) to ensure high-quality genomic data. Furthermore, clarify how the detected genomic alterations will be analyzed in the context of their potential impact on gene expression and patient outcomes. Including a diagram or flowchart to visualize the sequencing process could enhance understanding."

    "Part 4": {
        "Title": "DNA Methylation Analysis",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "Understanding DNA methylation patterns can provide insights into epigenetic regulation affecting gene expression in WDLPS and DDLPS. However, your focus may be more on gene expression than methylation differences.",
        "Suggestions": "Consider integrating methylation analysis to complement your gene expression data. Adapt the use of the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadsChip for profiling methylation patterns in your samples. Provide a rationale for how these methylation changes may correlate with the gene expression differences observed in your study, and outline the specific methods for comparison."
    },
    "Part 5": {
        "Title": "Phylogenetic Trees",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "The construction and analysis of phylogenetic trees can elucidate clonal evolution, which may indirectly inform your study on gene expression differences. However, this may not be a primary focus for your objectives.",
        "Suggestions": "If relevant, consider utilizing the phylogenetic tree methodologies to explore the relationships between different samples within your dataset. You can also use the statistical tests for comparing genomic alterations, explicitly stating how these relationships may inform the understanding of gene expression profiles. Including visual representations of the trees could enhance clarity."
    },
    "Part 6": {
        "Title": "Genomic Alterations",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "This section provides critical insights into genomic alterations relevant to DDLPS and WDLPS, which is integral to understanding prognostic factors and gene expression profiles in your study.",
        "Suggestions": "Utilize the guidelines for detecting somatic mutations and CNAs, and consider focusing on the specific genomic alterations highlighted, such as MDM2 and CDK4 amplifications. Discuss how these alterations might affect the clinical outcomes and gene expression in your study, and potentially include statistical analyses to support your findings."

    "Part 7": {
        "Title": "RNA Sequencing Analysis",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "The protocols for RNA sequencing are directly applicable to your study objectives, which focus on gene expression differences. The outlined quality control measures and analysis methods are essential for ensuring robust results.",
        "Suggestions": "Implement the RNA library preparation and sequencing protocols discussed. The gene expression analysis methods and GSEA approaches used should be directly applied to your RNA sequencing data to identify significant gene expression patterns. Additionally, clarify how you will correlate gene expression data with clinical outcomes and genomic alterations, possibly by integrating these analyses in a combined statistical model."
    },
    "Part 8": {
        "Title": "Mechanisms of Dedifferentiation",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "Analyzing the mechanisms of dedifferentiation could provide context for your findings, especially if you aim to understand the underlying processes affecting gene expression. However, it may not be the primary focus of your study.",
        "Suggestions": "Consider exploring the specific gene amplifications and their roles in dedifferentiation, as they may relate to the gene expression profiles you intend to analyze. Provide a rationale for how these mechanisms could inform the clinical implications of your findings, and potentially include a comparative analysis with existing literature on dedifferentiation."
