Load datasets GSE21122 (tissue type: 'Soft-tissue sarcoma', disease status: 'Liposarcoma'), GSE159659 (samples: 'dedifferentiated liposarcoma'), GSE30929 (samples: 'primary liposarcoma'), and GSE159848 (samples: 'mixoid liposarcoma'). Normalize data using the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) method. Set the p-value threshold for DEGs at <0.05 and the fold-change threshold at >2. After normalization, extract the list of DEGs, including their associated p-values and fold changes. Detailed instructions for using GEO2R: navigate to the GEO2R tool on the GEO website, select the datasets, and follow the prompts to normalize and analyze the data. Include screenshots for clarity if needed.\n\nConduct functional annotation of the identified DEGs using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Input the list of DEGs into DAVID and select 'Homo sapiens' as the background. Analyze the biological process, cellular component, and molecular function categories. Set the significance threshold for annotations at a p-value <0.05. Document the top 10 enriched terms for each category and their corresponding p-values. Include specific instructions for using DAVID, such as how to upload gene lists and interpret results, and suggest alternative annotation tools like Enrichr if initial results are unsatisfactory.\n\nPerform pathway enrichment analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Input the DEGs from the previous steps into the KEGG pathway analysis tool. Set the significance threshold for pathways at p-value <0.05. Document the top 10 significantly enriched pathways with their respective p-values and the number of DEGs involved in each pathway. Include clear instructions for using the KEGG database, such as how to input data and interpret the outputs. Suggest alternative pathway analysis tools like Reactome if necessary.\n\nCorrelate DEGs with immune response mechanisms by researching literature that links specific DEGs to immune responses in liposarcoma. Identify key immune-related genes from the DEG list and summarize their roles based on existing studies. Discuss the implications of these correlations in terms of potential therapeutic strategies targeting the immune microenvironment in liposarcoma. Provide references to key studies and consider suggesting alternative approaches for correlation if needed.\n\nConclude the protocol with a summary that encapsulates the findings and implications of the analysis. Highlight the significance of the identified DEGs and their potential roles in the immune microenvironment of liposarcoma. Discuss how these findings can inform future research directions and therapeutic strategies for liposarcoma.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 1 of experimental protocol.

        "input": "$Part 2 of Experimental protocol to be processed$: Part 2: Immune Landscape Analysis in Liposarcoma\n\nThe first step involves analyzing immune checkpoint and membrane marker expression across liposarcoma samples using RNA sequencing data from GSE202361 and GSE243904. Focus will be placed on immune checkpoint genes like PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, and others. Expression levels of these markers will be quantified using R software with the 'DESeq2' package for normalization and statistical analysis. The p-value threshold for significance will be set at <0.05, and false discovery rate (FDR) adjustments will be applied using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. A heatmap will be generated using the 'pheatmap' package in R to visualize the expression patterns of these markers across the samples.\n\nIn this step, we will estimate immune cell proportions using CIBERSORTx. The bulk RNA sequencing data from GSE202361 and GSE243904 will be uploaded to the CIBERSORTx web portal. We will select the leukocyte signature matrix version 2.0. The analysis will be run using the default parameters, ensuring batch correction is applied if necessary. If any outliers are detected, they will be excluded from the analysis. The output will include proportions of various immune cell types within each tumor sample and will be exported for further analysis.\n\nThis step will correlate immune cell distributions with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in Part 1. The immune cell proportions obtained from CIBERSORTx will be compared with the expression levels of DEGs using correlation analysis performed in R. Statistical methods such as Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients will be used to assess the relationship between immune cell types and DEGs. Additionally, patient outcomes (e.g., survival data) will be correlated with immune cell distributions and DEGs to assess their prognostic value using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.\n\nIn this step, we will discuss the implications of the findings for immunotherapy strategies tailored to liposarcoma. Specific examples of immune checkpoints, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, will be highlighted based on their expression levels and correlation with immune cell types. The discussion will focus on how these checkpoints can serve as therapeutic targets and the potential benefits of combination therapies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors and other treatments, referencing current literature on immunotherapy in sarcomas.\n\nThis final step involves characterizing immune cell populations and their functional implications in the tumor microenvironment. A detailed analysis will be conducted on the immune cell subpopulations identified in step 2, focusing on their functional roles, such as cytotoxicity, regulatory functions, and cytokine production. This characterization will be integrated with the findings from the DEG analysis to provide insights into how immune cell composition may influence tumor progression and response to therapies, including potential therapeutic implications.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 2 of experimental protocol.

                        "text": "$Part 2 of Experimental protocol to be processed$: Part 2: Immune Landscape Analysis in Liposarcoma\n\nThe first step involves analyzing immune checkpoint and membrane marker expression across liposarcoma samples using RNA sequencing data from GSE202361 and GSE243904. Focus will be placed on immune checkpoint genes like PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, and others. Expression levels of these markers will be quantified using R software with the 'DESeq2' package for normalization and statistical analysis. The p-value threshold for significance will be set at <0.05, and false discovery rate (FDR) adjustments will be applied using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. A heatmap will be generated using the 'pheatmap' package in R to visualize the expression patterns of these markers across the samples.\n\nIn this step, we will estimate immune cell proportions using CIBERSORTx. The bulk RNA sequencing data from GSE202361 and GSE243904 will be uploaded to the CIBERSORTx web portal. We will select the leukocyte signature matrix version 2.0. The analysis will be run using the default parameters, ensuring batch correction is applied if necessary. If any outliers are detected, they will be excluded from the analysis. The output will include proportions of various immune cell types within each tumor sample and will be exported for further analysis.\n\nThis step will correlate immune cell distributions with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in Part 1. The immune cell proportions obtained from CIBERSORTx will be compared with the expression levels of DEGs using correlation analysis performed in R. Statistical methods such as Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients will be used to assess the relationship between immune cell types and DEGs. Additionally, patient outcomes (e.g., survival data) will be correlated with immune cell distributions and DEGs to assess their prognostic value using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.\n\nIn this step, we will discuss the implications of the findings for immunotherapy strategies tailored to liposarcoma. Specific examples of immune checkpoints, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, will be highlighted based on their expression levels and correlation with immune cell types. The discussion will focus on how these checkpoints can serve as therapeutic targets and the potential benefits of combination therapies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors and other treatments, referencing current literature on immunotherapy in sarcomas.\n\nThis final step involves characterizing immune cell populations and their functional implications in the tumor microenvironment. A detailed analysis will be conducted on the immune cell subpopulations identified in step 2, focusing on their functional roles, such as cytotoxicity, regulatory functions, and cytokine production. This characterization will be integrated with the findings from the DEG analysis to provide insights into how immune cell composition may influence tumor progression and response to therapies, including potential therapeutic implications.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 2 of experimental protocol.

Analyze key metrics such as Phred quality scores (with a cutoff of 20), GC content, and the presence of adapter sequences. Afterward, use MultiQC (version 1.9) to compile the results from FastQC for easier assessment of quality across all samples. Remove low-quality reads and trim adapter sequences using Trimmomatic (version 0.39) with the following parameters: LEADING:20, TRAILING:20, SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20, MINLEN:50. Store the cleaned reads in a designated directory for further analysis. Utilize datasets GSE21122, GSE159659, GSE30929, and GSE159848 for quality control assessment.\n\nConduct differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 (version 1.30.1) on the cleaned RNA sequencing data. Load the libraries and the data into R. Prepare the count matrix using the cleaned reads and create a DESeqDataSet object, specifying the design formula to account for experimental conditions (e.g., liposarcoma vs. normal tissue). Run the DESeq function on the DESeqDataSet object, applying default settings. Extract the results using the results function with an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05 to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between liposarcoma and normal tissue samples. Save the results in a CSV file for further analysis. The analysis will incorporate data from the GSE21122 and GSE30929 datasets.\n\nPerform gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify relevant pathways and biological processes associated with the identified DEGs. Utilize the clusterProfiler (version 3.18.1) R package to run GSEA. Input the list of DEGs ranked by their log2 fold change and p-values. Use the KEGG and GO databases for pathway analysis, ensuring to set the significance threshold at an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05. Visualize the results with dot plots and enrichment plots to illustrate enriched pathways and their significance. Save the enriched pathways results in a designated directory for reporting.

Use the RNA sequencing datasets GSE202361, GSE205492, and GSE243904, which contain transcriptomic information relevant to liposarcoma. Normalize the data using the TPM (Transcripts Per Million) normalization method to ensure comparability across samples.

Once normalized, extract the gene expression matrix, focusing particularly on immune-related genes. Ensure that the matrix dimensions match the expected input format for CIBERSORT, which requires gene symbols as rows and samples as columns.\n\nRun CIBERSORT using the prepared immune-related gene expression matrix as input. Set the parameter for the signature matrix to the LM22 gene signature file provided by CIBERSORT, which contains 547 immune cell-specific gene expression profiles. Adjust the number of permutations to 100 to ensure robust statistical validation. Specify the output format to include estimated cell types and their respective proportions within each liposarcoma sample. After execution, save the results as a CSV file for further analysis. The output will be used to correlate immune cell populations with clinical parameters in subsequent steps.\n\nAnalyze the CIBERSORT output to correlate immune cell type distributions with clinical parameters such as patient prognosis and treatment outcomes. Use statistical analysis methods (e.g., Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests) to evaluate the relationship between specific immune cell populations and patient survival rates. Additionally, integrate these findings with previously identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from Part 1 of the experiment to assess how immune cell infiltration impacts gene expression profiles related to immune response mechanisms.

                        "text": "$Part 4 of Experimental protocol to be processed$: Part 4: Characterization of Immune Cell Infiltration Using CIBERSORT\n\nBegin by preparing the RNA sequencing data from liposarcoma samples. Use the RNA sequencing datasets GSE202361, GSE205492, and GSE243904, which contain transcriptomic information relevant to liposarcoma. Normalize the data using the TPM (Transcripts Per Million) normalization method to ensure comparability across samples. Handling of missing values should be performed through imputation or exclusion, depending on the extent of missingness. Once normalized, extract the gene expression matrix, focusing particularly on immune-related genes. Ensure that the matrix dimensions match the expected input format for CIBERSORT, which requires gene symbols as rows and samples as columns.\n\nRun CIBERSORT using the prepared immune-related gene expression matrix as input. Set the parameter for the signature matrix to the LM22 gene signature file provided by CIBERSORT, which contains 547 immune cell-specific gene expression profiles. Adjust the number of permutations to 100 to ensure robust statistical validation. Specify the output format to include estimated cell types and their respective proportions within each liposarcoma sample. After execution, save the results as a CSV file for further analysis. The output will be used to correlate immune cell populations with clinical parameters in subsequent steps.\n\nAnalyze the CIBERSORT output to correlate immune cell type distributions with clinical parameters such as patient prognosis and treatment outcomes. Use statistical analysis methods (e.g., Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests) to evaluate the relationship between specific immune cell populations and patient survival rates. Additionally, integrate these findings with previously identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from Part 1 of the experiment to assess how immune cell infiltration impacts gene expression profiles related to immune response mechanisms. This integration will help refine the understanding of the immune landscape in liposarcoma and guide potential therapeutic strategies.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 4 of experimental protocol. Your task is to accurately identify and extract sections that correspond to dry experiments, which are defined as data downloading, data processing, computational analysis, or other activities not involving wet-lab procedures.\n\nFor each identified dry experimental step, focus on detailing:\n- A clear task description.\n- The specific inputs required, along with their detailed description and types.\n- The expected outputs, including their detailed description and types.\n\nEnsure that your extraction is specific to dry experiments.

Each task corresponds to a specific dry experimental step, and the descriptions accurately reflect the actions to be taken. However, there are a few areas where the specificity could be improved, particularly in the description of inputs and outputs.\n\n**Detail: 4/5**\n- The extraction captures the essential steps of the experimental protocol, including data downloading, preprocessing, normalization, clustering, correlation analysis, and differential expression analysis. However, some tasks could benefit from additional detail regarding the specific methods or parameters used in the analyses, as well as the expected format of the outputs.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Task Descriptions:**\n   - Some task descriptions could be more explicit about the methods or algorithms used. For example, when discussing normalization or clustering, mentioning specific parameters or settings (e.g., the exact method for quality control checks) would enhance clarity.\n\n2. **Input Details:**\n   - The inputs could be described with more specificity. For instance, when mentioning \"raw single-cell RNA sequencing data,\" it would be beneficial to specify the format (e.g., raw counts, TPM, etc.) and any relevant metadata that accompanies the data.\n\n3. **Output Details:**\n   - The expected outputs should include more detail about their structure and content. For example, when discussing the UMAP plots, it would be helpful to specify what information is visualized (e.g., clusters, cell types) and in what format the plots will be saved (e.g., PNG, PDF).\n\n4. **Statistical Analysis:**\n   - The statistical tests mentioned (e.g., Spearman correlation) could include more detail about how the results will be interpreted and what specific metrics will be reported (e.g., correlation coefficients, p-values).\n\n5. **Consistency in Terminology:**\n   - Ensure that the terminology used throughout the tasks is consistent. For example, if \"single-cell RNA sequencing data\" is used in one task, it should be referred to in the same way in all tasks to avoid confusion.\n\n### Final Integral Score\n[4.0]"
