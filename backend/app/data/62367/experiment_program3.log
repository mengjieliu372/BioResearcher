Based on integrative bioinformatic analysis, we show that hLMS originate from vascular smooth muscle cells presenting both contractile and synthetic characteristics, while oLMS could derive from fibroblasts.

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}, 'GSE21122': {'Status': 'Public on Jul 06, 2010', 'Title': 'Whole-transcript expression data for soft-tissue sarcoma tumors and control normal fat specimens', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Experiment type': 'Expression profiling by array', 'Summary': 'Soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive mesenchymal cancers that affect more than 10,600 new patients per year in the US, about 40% of whom will die of their disease. Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.

For instance, it could suggest alternative methods for DEG identification if the initial approach does not yield sufficient results.\n\n5. **Logical Structure (Score: 4)**  \n   The protocol is logically structured, with a clear progression from data normalization to DEG identification, functional annotation, and pathway analysis. However, the flow could be improved by explicitly linking the outcomes of each step to the subsequent steps.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported. To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}, 'GSE21122': {'Status': 'Public on Jul 06, 2010', 'Title': 'Whole-transcript expression data for soft-tissue sarcoma tumors and control normal fat specimens', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Experiment type': 'Expression profiling by array', 'Summary': 'Soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive mesenchymal cancers that affect more than 10,600 new patients per year in the US, about 40% of whom will die of their disease. Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported. To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production. The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS. Additional studies in diverse sarcoma subtypes will be essential to confirm and expand upon these findings.', 'Overall design': 'To decipher the mechanism of action of PRMT5 inhibition in STS cell lines, we explored the transcriptomic changes in IB111 cells after 10 days of treatment by RNA sequencing.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported.  To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays.  High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.  The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS. Additional studies in diverse sarcoma subtypes will be essential to confirm and expand upon these findings.', 'Overall design': 'To decipher the mechanism of action of PRMT5 inhibition in STS cell lines, four sarcoma cell lines (the IB111, IB114, IB115, and IB128 cells) were untreated or treated with GSK595 at IC80 every 3 days for 10 days and RNA were analyzed by Nanostring assay using an nCounter Metabolic Pathways Panel in the nCounter Max Analyzer.', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL31904, NanoString  nCounter Human  Metabolic Pathways Panel [Gene Symbol version]', 'Samples': {'GSM7795419': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM7795419', 'name': 'IB111 cell line, Control, rep1', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM7795419_20211109_31020962105_run2_IB111_n1_ctl_07.RCC.gz', 'file_size': '8.7 Kb', 'file_type': 'RCC', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM7795419&format=file&file=GSM7795419%5F20211109%5F31020962105%5Frun2%5FIB111%5Fn1%5Fctl%5F07%2ERCC%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 25, 2023', 'Title': 'IB111 cell line, Control, rep1', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell type: dedifferentiated liposarcoma', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were untreated or treated with GSK595 at their respective IC80 every 3 days for 10 days', 'Growth protocol': 'Cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 GlutaMAX Supplement in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen).

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets.

Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.

Based on integrative bioinformatic analysis, we show that hLMS originate from vascular smooth muscle cells presenting both contractile and synthetic characteristics, while oLMS could derive from fibroblasts.

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}, 'GSE21122': {'Status': 'Public on Jul 06, 2010', 'Title': 'Whole-transcript expression data for soft-tissue sarcoma tumors and control normal fat specimens', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Experiment type': 'Expression profiling by array', 'Summary': 'Soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive mesenchymal cancers that affect more than 10,600 new patients per year in the US, about 40% of whom will die of their disease. Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.

The primary endpoint of pathologic response as assessed by percent hyalinization was observed to be a median of 8.8% in DDLPS patients and 89% in UPS patients and similar in nivolumab and ipilimumab/nivolumab arms in both cohorts\\xa0. Higher intratumoral densities of T-regulatory cells were associated with absence of pathologic response (hyalinization<30%). Tumor infiltration by B-cells was associated with higher densities of T-regulatory cells before treatment;  this association was lost upon ICB treatment.

To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS.

High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients.

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}, 'GSE21122': {'Status': 'Public on Jul 06, 2010', 'Title': 'Whole-transcript expression data for soft-tissue sarcoma tumors and control normal fat specimens', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Experiment type': 'Expression profiling by array', 'Summary': 'Soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive mesenchymal cancers that affect more than 10,600 new patients per year in the US, about 40% of whom will die of their disease. Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.
