            "Summary": "Recent evidence suggests that immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has some activity in metastatic dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS). We conducted a randomized, non-comparative phase 2 trial (NCT03307616) of nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab in patients with resectable retroperitoneal DDLPS (n=17) and extremity/truncal UPS (n=10), with UPS patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy. The primary endpoint of pathologic response as assessed by percent hyalinization was observed to be a median of 8.8% in DDLPS patients and 89% in UPS patients and similar in nivolumab and ipilimumab/nivolumab arms in both cohorts . Higher intratumoral densities of T-regulatory cells were associated with absence of pathologic response (hyalinization<30%). Tumor infiltration by B-cells was associated with higher densities of T-regulatory cells before treatment;  this association was lost upon ICB treatment. Our data demonstrate that neoadjuvant ICB with concurrent radiation may have significant efficacy in UPS and is associated complex immune changes in the tumor microenvironment in DDLPS and UPS.",

The purified RNA was quantified using Quant-iT™ RiboGreen™ RNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher SCIENTIFIC) and the RNA quality was accessed using Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit and the 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument (Agilent Technologies).Up to 200 ng of each cDNA sample based on the PicoGreen quantification was sheared (mechanically fragmented) using the E220 Focused-ultrasonicator Covaris (Covaris). The sonication was performed under the following conditions: Peak Incident Power 200, Duty Cycle 25%, Cycles per Burst 50, and duration 10 seconds for 120 iterations. To ensure the proper fragment size, samples were examined on TapeStation 4200 using the DNA High Sensitivity kit (Agilent Technologies). The sheared cDNA was proceeded to library preparation using SureSelect XT Low Input Reagent Kit with indexes 1-96 (Agilent Technologies) as automated method on the Sciclone G3 NGSx Workstation (PerkinElmer, Inc.).This protocol consists of 3 enzymatic reactions for end repair, A-tailing and Adaptor ligation, followed by barcode insertion by PCR using Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase (8 to 14 cycles, based on input DNA quality and quantity). PCR primers were removed by using 1x volume of Agencourt AMPure PCR Purification kit (Agencourt Bioscience Corporation). The quality and quantity of the prepared libraries were evaluated using TapeStation 4200 and the DNA High Sensitivity kit (Agilent Technologies) to verify correct fragment size and to ensure complete removal of primer dimers.",

            "Summary": "Patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs) have few therapeutic options. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported. To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production. The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS. Additional studies in diverse sarcoma subtypes will be essential to confirm and expand upon these findings.",

            "Summary": "Based on the transcriptome analysis of 555 sarcomas, we identified a group of tightly clustered leiomyosarcomas (LMS) due to their gene expression homogeneity. We named them “hLMS” and the other LMS “oLMS”. We derived a transcriptional signature able to identify each group and used it to classify patients from two independent cohorts. In all cohorts, hLMS were preferentially carried by women, located in the internal trunk, highly differentiated, and similarly altered at the genomic level. Based on integrative bioinformatic analysis, we show that hLMS originate from vascular smooth muscle cells presenting both contractile and synthetic characteristics, while oLMS could derive from fibroblasts. We found strong MYOCD expression to be an hLMS-specific driver and show that the MYOCD/SRF axis is essential only for hLMS survival. Identification of hLMS could become standard clinical practice, leading to the development of specific effective treatments with MYOCD/SRF inhibitors.",

            "Summary": "Liposarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma, accounting for about 20% of cases. Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.",

            "Summary": "Soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive mesenchymal cancers that affect more than 10,600 new patients per year in the US, about 40% of whom will die of their disease. Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation. Our study yields the most detailed map of molecular alterations across diverse sarcoma subtypes to date and provides potential subtype-specific targets for therapy.",
