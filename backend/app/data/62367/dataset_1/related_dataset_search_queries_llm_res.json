This group of genes was largely dependant on autocrine type I interferon (IFN) signaling, as their induction was blocked by neutralizing antibody targeting the type I IFN receptor. Coupling these experiments with a meta-analysis of other published works led to the identification of a set of 32 functionally conserved genes that was reproducibly activated by different types of CpG DNA in different species and cell types.

In 2000, Perou and colleagues demonstrated that tumor phenotypic diversity correlates with differences in global gene expression patterns, which in turn reflect aspects of the biological behavior of the tumors. Gene expression profiling has distinguished sporadic breast tumor sub-classes with genetic, histopathological and clinical differences, however, little is known about the molecular classification of hereditary breast tumors. It has been recently suggested that most tumors arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers display a basal-like phenotype, with the percentages reported in different studies ranging from 44 to almost 100%. In the present study we used expression profiling to produce a molecular classification of BRCA1-associated breast tumors and applied an integrative approach to examine biological dependencies or differences.Methods and Findings: We used frozen tumor tissue from fourteen patients all of which harbored germline pathological mutations in BRCA1. Total RNA extraction, amplification and labeling with Cy5 were performed using standard protocols. Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene) was used as a reference and labeled with Cy3. Each pair of Cy3/Cy5 samples was hybridized onto the CNIO human OncoChip V2, which consists of a spotted microarray with 11,675 cDNA clones from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium. Two channel ratios (Cy5/Cy3) for each spot were generated and quantified using GenePix Pro 5.1 (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA, USA). Data were normalized and filtered and multiple statistical analyses were performed. The data are deposited in the GEO database under the accession number GSE12350. A tissue microarray (TMA) containing an independent series of 15 BRCA1 tumors was used to validate some of the results obtained.We have described molecular signatures that define BRCA1 subclasses depending on the expression of the gene encoding for Estrogen Receptor, ESR1. Signatures were found to be molecularly associated with different biological processes and transcriptional regulatory programs. The signature of ESR1-positive tumors was mainly linked to cell proliferation-related processes and, therefore, regulated by the estrogen receptor, while the signature of ESR1-negative tumors was mainly linked to the immune response and possibly regulated by transcription factors of the REL/NFκB family. These signatures were then verified in an independent series of hereditary and sporadic breast tumors, which revealed a possible prognostic value for each subclass. Over-expression of immune response genes appears to be a common feature of ER-negative sporadic and hereditary breast cancer and is associated with good prognosis. Interestingly, the ESR1-negative tumors were sub-stratified into two groups presenting light differences in the magnitude of the expression of immune response transcripts and REL/NFκB transcription factors, and this could be dependent on the type of germline alteration. In addition, analysis of the human protein-protein interaction network provides the wiring diagram of critical molecular associations in BRCA1 tumorigenesis and identifies close relationships between the different signatures. Conclusions: In summary, in the present study we have established the gene expression profiling of a series of BRCA1 tumors and found that there is a further degree of heterogeneity beyond the main classification by the expression of ESR1 and the presence or absence of a basal-like phenotype. We have identified specific signatures for ESR1-positive and ESR1-negative BRCA1 tumors, the latter characterized by the enrichment of immune response and cell cycle genes, and have found that slight differences in the level of expression of the immune response stratify the ESR1-negative BRCA1 tumors into two additional sub-groups (A and B) with possible prognostic differences. NFkB could be a major driver responsible for the levels of both immune response and apoptotic genes in this group of tumors, which could in turn be related to the type of germline mutation in BRCA1. This study reveals the molecular complexity of BRCA1 breast tumors, which are found to display similarities to sporadic tumors, and suggests possible prognostic implications.', 'Overall design': '14 samples (primary breast tumors containing a BRCA1 mutation) were hybridized to a cDNA microarray in order to investigate the possible heterogeneity within the BRCA1 group.', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL5645, CNIO Human Oncochip 2.0', 'Samples': {'GSM310290': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM310290', 'name': 'BRCA1 primary tumor_02T144', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM310290.gpr.gz', 'file_size': '2.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'GPR', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM310290&format=file&file=GSM310290%2Egpr%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Oct 14, 2009', 'Title': 'BRCA1 primary tumor_02T144', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'Collection of RNA pooled from ten cell lines (adenocarcinoma, mammary gland hepatoblastoma, liver adenocarcinoma, cervix embryonal carcinoma, testis glioblastoma, brain melanoma liposarcoma histiocytic lymphoma; macrophase; histocyte lymphoblastic leukemia plasmacytoma; myeloma; B lymphocyte)Control', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': \"Total RNA was extracted using Trizol following manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Description': 'Gene expression analysis of primary breast tumor that contains BRCA1 mutation', 'Data processing': 'The data were normalized using default values of GEPAS 4.0 (within-array correction, print-tip lowess).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL5645'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE12350_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '33.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of GPR)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE12350&format=file'}]}\n\n\nA dataset can be judged useful only when it can be used to conduct the experiments required for the research.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported. To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production. The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS.

Each adapter contained a T-base overhang for ligating the adapter to the A-tailed fragmented DNA. Dual-index adapters were ligated to the fragments, and size selection was performed with AMPureXP beads.

To determine how tumor heterogeneity shapes the immune microenvironment and impacts responses to therapy, we modeled heterogeneous tumors comprised of a pro-inflammatory (“hot”) and an immunosuppressive (“cold”) tumor population. This was done by mixing two squamous skin carcinoma cell lines that alone give rise to tumors with a reproducible immunologically “hot” or “cold” immune phenotype respectively, and labeling these with YFP or RFP fluorescent tags to enable precise spatial tracking. The resulting mixed-population tumors were made up of a patchwork of distinct regions that could be classified as being comprised of YFP+(“hot”) cells, RFP+(“cold”) cells, or a mixture of YFP+and RFP+cells. We find the spatial organization of tumor cells creates a blueprint for the spatial organization and functional activity of infiltrating immune cells, defining the architecture of both tumor-infiltrating T cell and myeloid cell compartments. Using a combination of microdissection techniques and single-cell spatial transcriptomics, we show that YFP regions harbor a higher frequency of Th1 cells and IFNψ+CD8 T cells compared to RFP regions, whereas immunosuppressive macrophages preferentially accumulate in RFP regions. Total CD4 T cells were also enriched in YFP regions, but by contrast, total CD8 T cells—despite their superior function in YFP regions—were of low abundance throughout the heterogeneous tumors. We identify the chemokine Cx3cl1, produced at higher levels by our “cold” tumors, as a mediator of intratumoral macrophage abundance, and show that overexpression of Cx3cl1 in pro-inflammatory (“hot”) tumor cells leads to an increase in immunosuppressive CD206Himacrophages. We further interrogated the impact of this spatial patterning of immune cells on the responses of heterogeneous tumors to checkpoint blockade. We find that combination of PD-1 blockade and CD40 agonist is able to increase the Th1 response in “cold” RFP regions, however the T cell response in “cold” regions remains inferior to “hot” regions and treatment achieves only a modest reduction in tumor growth.

On the other hand, IAV infects lung epithelial cells and manipulates their function to establish a non-protective, permissive environment. Identification of epithelial factors and pathways that can be targeted to restore optimal immunity would provide new therapeutic options against IAV. Here, we demonstrate an unexpected non-immune function for the cytokine RELMɑ in mediating a permissive environment for IAV infection through lung epithelial cell-intrinsic effects. Murine infection with IAV A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) led to the significant RELMɑ secretion by IAV-infected EpCam+ epithelial cells. Both constitutive and club cell-specific RELMɑ-deficient mice (Retnla-/- and RetnlaΔCC10) had significantly reduced IAV virus, specifically in epithelial cells, whereas the lung immune response was unaffected. RELMɑ treatment increased IAV infection of murine lung epithelial cell lines (MLE), and transcriptomic analysis indicated that RELMɑ-induced permissiveness to IAV was associated with cell-intrinsic changes in metabolic activity. Collectively, these studies indicate a direct non-immune role for RELMɑ in mediating a virus-permissive environment in epithelial cells potentially through modulation of cellular metabolism.', 'Overall design': 'To investigate transcriptional changes in mouse lung epithelial cells (Mle2) in response to Influenza A virus (IAV) in the presence or absence of RELMα (Ra) treamentCells were either treated with PBS or RELMα prior to IAV infection and recovered for gene expression profiling with RNA-seqThe dataset is comprised of four groups (ctrl, Ra, ctrl+IAV, Ra+IAV) each with four independent biological replicates.

FER controls a myriad of plant developmental processes including sexual reproduction, cell growth and morphogenesis, often intersecting with phytohormones-dependent pathways such as abscisic acid (ABA) or plant immunity.

Here, we carried out comparative transcriptomics and proteomics approach on Mpfer-1 and Mpmri-1 knock-down mutant plants and the wild-type strains Tak-1 and Tak-2. Our -omics analyses revealed that globally, MpFER and MpMRI largely cooperate to negatively regulate transcriptional and translational networks in particular those related to plant defense and ABA responses.

This persistence is due to the continual replenishment of short-live effector CD8+ T cells (autoimmune mediators, Tmed) in the pancreatic lymph nodes (pLNs) by a long-lived reservoir of stem-like memory CD8+ T cells (autoimmune progenitors, Tprog). We are investigating an epigenetic regulator UTX playing the role in Tprog to Tmed conversion. The NOD mice with T cell-specific UTX deficiency (UTXTCD mice) were protected from T1D. In addition, the deletion of UTX in CD8+ T cells resulted in the accumulation of Tprog and loss of Tmed populations in pLNs. The function of UTX is to demethylate the histone mark, H3K27 tri-methylation, leading to the open chromatin accessibility for gene expression. ATAC-seq and RNA-seq of antigen specific Tprog cells revealed a role of UTX in closing chromatin at progenitor gene loci while enforcing accessibility at effector gene loci.

Gene expression analysis was performed with the DESeq2 package (version 1.44.0), which included filtering low expressing genes, calculating normalized gene counts, calculating the between-sample distance matrix, principal component analysis, and performing a differential expression analysis.Assembly: mm10Supplementary files format and content: Excel spreadsheet containing normalized reads', 'Platform ID': 'GPL34290'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE282716_all-reads.xlsx', 'file_size': '3.7 Mb', 'file_type': 'XLSX', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE282716&format=file&file=GSE282716%5Fall%2Dreads%2Exlsx'}]}\n\n\nA dataset can be judged useful only when it can be used to conduct the experiments required for the research.

However, the molecular changes that occur as precancerous lesions progress to HGSOC are not well understood. To address this, we integrated high-plex imaging and spatial transcriptomics to analyze human tissue samples at different stages of HGSOC development, including p53 signatures, serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STIC), and invasive HGSOC. Our findings reveal immune modulating mechanisms within precursor epithelium, characterized by chromosomal instability, persistent interferon (IFN) signaling, and dysregulated innate and adaptive immunity. FT precursors display elevated expression of MHC-class I, including HLA-E, and IFN-stimulated genes, typically linked to later-stage tumorigenesis. These molecular alterations coincide with progressive shifts in the tumor microenvironment, transitioning from immune surveillance in early STICs to immune suppression in advanced STICs and cancer. These insights identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HGSOC interception and clarify the molecular transitions from precancer to cancer.', 'Overall design': 'We have 44 specimens from 43 pre-cancer patients with and without cancer. Out of 44, we performed microregional spatial transcriptomics (GeoMx) on 35 specimens. Mostly these precancer leisons are incidental p53 signatures, incidental STIC, and STIC associated with cancer.
