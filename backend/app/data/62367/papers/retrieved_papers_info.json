        "abstract": "Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) is the most frequent high-grade soft tissue sarcoma subtype. It is characterized by a component of undifferentiated tumor cells coexisting with a component of well-differentiated adipocytic tumor cells. Both dedifferentiated (DD) and well-differentiated (WD) components exhibit MDM2 amplification, however their cellular origin remains elusive. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, DNA sequencing, in situ multiplex immunofluorescence and functional assays in paired WD and DD components from primary DDLPS tumors, we characterize the cellular heterogeneity of DDLPS tumor and micro-environment. We identify a population of tumor adipocyte stem cells (ASC) showing striking similarities with adipocyte stromal progenitors found in white adipose tissue. We show that tumor ASC harbor the ancestral genomic alterations of WD and DD components, suggesting that both derive from these progenitors following clonal evolution. Last, we show that DD tumor cells keep important biological properties of ASC including pluripotency and that their adipogenic properties are inhibited by a TGF-Î²-high immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment.",

Clinical trials assessing immunotherapy in these tumors have so far reported limited efficacy. The objective of this study is to provide a description of the immunologic landscape of sarcomas to guide the next clinical trials of immunotherapy in these diseases. The gene expression profile of 93 immune checkpoint (ICP) and membrane markers (MM) of immune cells was analyzed in a series of 253 soft tissue sarcoma (synovial sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, sarcoma with complex genomic and GIST) using Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarrays. The unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression level was found able to properly group patients according to the histological subgroup of sarcoma, indicating that each sarcoma subgroup is associated with a specific immune signature defined by its gene expression pattern. Using the prognostic impact of CIBERSORT signature on metastatic-free survival in each subgroup, specific target could be proposed for each of the four groups: Treg through ICOS and GITR in GIST, M0 macrophages in all four sarcoma subtypes, OX40 in SS, CD40 in GIST and SS.

        "abstract": "<p id=\"Par1\">Breast cancer (BRCA) is one of the pivotal causes of female death worldwide. And the morbidity and mortality of breast cancer have increased rapidly. Immune checkpoints are important to maintain immune tolerance and are regarded as important therapeutic targets. However, research for BRCA were limited to single immune checkpoint-related gene (ICG) and few studies have systematically explored expression profile of Immune checkpoint-related genes or attempted to construct a prognostic gene risk model based on immune checkpoint-related genes. We identified immune checkpoint-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BRCA and normal breast tissues from TCGA database. A 7-gene signature was created by utilizing the univariate Cox regression model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression method. In addition, we conducted a nomogram to predict the prognostic significance. This tool enables quantitative prediction of patient prognosis, serving as a valuable reference for clinical decision-making, thereby improving patient outcomes. Relationships between our risk model and clinical indicators, TME (Tumor Microenvironment), immune cell infiltration, immune response and drug susceptibility were investigated. A set of in vitro cell assays was conducted to decipher the relationship between MAP2K6 and proliferation, invasion, migration, colony formation and apoptosis rate of breast cancer cells. As a result, we established a prognostic model composed of seven ICGs in BRCA. Based on the median risk score, BRCA patients were equally assigned into two groups of high- and low-risk. High-risk BRCA patients have poorer OS (overall survival) than low-risk patients. In addition, there were remarkable differences between these two groups in clinicopathological features, TME, immune cell infiltration, immune response and drug susceptibility. The results of GO and KEGG analyses indicated that DEGs between the high- and low-risk groups were involved in immune-related biological processes and pathways. GSEA analysis also showed that a number of immune-related pathways were notably enriched in the low-risk group. Finally, results of cell-based assays indicated that MAP2K6 may play a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of breast cancer as a tumor suppressor gene. In conclusion, we created a novel ICG signature that has the potential to predict the survival and drug sensitivity of BRCA patients. Furthermore, this study indicated that MAP2K6 may serve as a novel target for BRCA therapy.</p>",

Herein, we demonstrate a strong anti-leukemic effect of AM injected (Ai) into the mouse model of erythroleukemia induced by Friend virus. Chemical analysis combined with mass spectrometry of AM/Ai identified the compounds Betulinic acid, Kaempferol, Hederagenin, and formononetin, all major mediators of leukemia inhibition in culture and in vivo. Docking analysis demonstrated binding of these four compounds to FLI1, resulting in downregulation of its targets, induction of apoptosis, differentiation, and suppression of cell proliferation. Chemical composition analysis identified other compounds previously known having anti-tumor activity independent of the FLI1 blockade. Among these, Astragaloside-A (As-A) has marginal effect on cells in culture, but strongly inhibits leukemogenesis in vivo, likely through improvement of anti-tumor immunity. Indeed, both IDO1 and TDO2 were identified as targets of As-A, leading to suppression of tryptophane-mediated Kyn production and leukemia suppression. Moreover, As-A interacts with histamine decarboxylase (HDC), leading to suppression of anti-inflammatory genes TNF, IL1B/IL1A, TNFAIP3, and CXCR2, but not IL6.

This review focuses on examining the growing potential of immunotherapy in targeting the unique challenges posed by bone metastases.

        "abstract": "<p id=\"Par1\">Cancer is a global health problem and one of the leading causes of mortality. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the field of oncology, emerging as a powerful treatment strategy. A key pathway that has garnered considerable attention is programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1). The interaction between PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and PD-1 reduces the innate immune response and thus compromises the capability of the bodyâs immune system. Furthermore, it controls the phenotype and functionality of innate and adaptive immune components. A range of monoclonal antibodies, including avelumab, atezolizumab, camrelizumab, dostarlimab, durvalumab, sinitilimab, toripalimab, and zimberelimab, have been developed for targeting the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1. These agents can induce a broad spectrum of autoimmune-like complications that may affect any organ system. Recent studies have focused on the effect of various natural compounds that inhibit immune checkpoints. This could contribute to the existing arsenal of anticancer drugs. Several bioactive natural agents have been shown to affect the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis, promoting tumor cell apoptosis, influencing cell proliferation, and eventually leading to tumor cell death and inhibiting cancer progression. However, there is a substantial knowledge gap regarding the role of different natural compounds targeting PD-1 in the context of cancer. Hence, this review aims to provide a common connection between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and the anticancer effects of distinct natural molecules. Moreover, the primary focus will be on the underlying mechanism of action as well as the clinical efficacy of bioactive molecules. Current challenges along with the scope of future research directions targeting PD-1/PD-L1 interactions through natural substances are also discussed.</p>",

GD2 is a suitable target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy due to its overexpression in several solid tumors. In this preclinical study, we investigated the potential use of iCasp9.2A.GD2.CAR-CD28.4â1BBÎ¶ (CAR.GD2) T-cells as a treatment option for patients who have GD2-positive sarcomas and we sought to identify factors shaping hostile tumor microenvironment in this setting. GD2 expression was evaluated by flow-cytometry on primary tumor biopsies of pediatric sarcoma patients. GD2 expression in sarcoma cells was also evaluated in response to an enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibitor (Tazemetostat). The antitumor activity of CAR.GD2 T-cells was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of orthotopic and/or metastatic soft-tissue and bone sarcomas. GD2 expression was detected in 55% of the primary tumors. Notably, the Osteosarcoma and Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcomas subtypes exhibited the highest GD2 expression levels, while Ewing sarcoma showed the lowest. CAR.GD2 T-cells show a significant tumor control both in vitro and in vivo models of GD2-expressing tumors. Pretreatment with an EZH2 inhibitor (Tazemetostat) upregulating GD2 expression, sensitizes GD2<sup>dim</sup> sarcoma cells to CAR.GD2 T-cells cytotoxic activity. Moreover, in mouse models of disseminated Rhabdomyosarcomas and orthotopic Osteosarcoma, CAR.GD2 T-cells showed both a vigorous anti-tumor activity and long-term persistence as compared to un-transduced T-cells. The presence of immunosuppressive murine myeloid-derived suppressor (MDSC) cells significantly reduces long-term anti-tumour activity of infused CAR.GD2 T-cells. Tumor-derived G-CSF was found to be one of the key factors driving expansion of immunosuppressive murine and human MDSC, thus indirectly limiting the efficacy of CAR.GD2 T-cells. Our preclinical data strongly suggest that CAR.GD2 T-cells hold promise as a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with GD2-positive sarcomas.

Changes in cell metabolism, such as glycolysis, may provide the environment for the transformation and progression of tumors. We aimed to build a model to predict prognosis of EwS patients based on glycolysis and metabolism genes. Candidate genes were obtained by differential gene expression analysis based on GSE17679, GSE17674 and ICGC datasets. We performed GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on candidate genes. Univariate Cox and LASSO Cox regression analyses were conducted to construct a model to calculate the Risk Score. GSEA was done between high-risk and low-risk groups. CIBERSORT was applied to analyze the immune landscape. We got 295 candidate glycolysis-metabolism-related genes which were enriched in 620 GO terms and 18 KEGG pathways. 12 Genes were selected by univariate Cox model and 5 of them were determined by LASSO Cox regression analysis to be used in the construction of the Risk Score model. The Risk Score could be considered as an independent prognosis factor. The immune landscape and immune checkpoints' expression significantly differed between high- and low-risk groups.

        "abstract": "Therapeutic options for synovial sarcoma (SyS) have not evolved for several decades and the efficacy of second-line treatments is very limited. The expression of a large family of proteins known as cancer testis antigens (CTAs) in SyS has spurred the development of targeted T-cell therapies currently in clinical trials, such as those aimed at melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE)-A4 and New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1), which have shown promising clinical efficacy. Extensive knowledge of the prevalence of expression and coexpression of CTAs is critical to design T-cell therapies with optimal coverage of the patient population. We analyzed the expression of CTAs of the MAGE-A family as well as NY-ESO-1 and preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) by RNA sequencing in a large cohort of 133 SyS samples from patients registered in the French sarcoma database (NETSARC+). Among MAGE-As, MAGE-A4 had the highest prevalence (65%), followed by MAGE-A10 (15%) and MAGE-A9 (13%). Almost all samples (92%) expressing any of the MAGE-As also expressed MAGE-A4. NY-ESO-1 was expressed in 65% of samples, with a large but incomplete overlap with MAGE-A4, whereas PRAME was present in 121 (91%) samples. Complementary immunohistochemical analyses were used to establish the positive correlation between RNA and protein expression for MAGE-A4 and NY-ESO-1.

RNA-Seq data from 237 STS were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. Patients were stratified by H2AX mRNA expression using a survival-associated cutoff. Differentially expressed genes and pathways as well as immune signatures between H2AXhigh- and H2AXlow tumors were identified with DESeq2 analysis, gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA), Enrichr pathway analysis and CIBERSORTx. Tissue microarrays of a different cohort of 291 STS were generated for immunohistochemical staining to assess Î³-H2AX protein expression, followed by statistical evaluation. High H2AX mRNA expression was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) in STS (pâ=â0.02), particularly in leiomyosarcomas (LMS) (pâ<â0.001), and was a negative prognostic factor in LMS (HR 11.15, pâ<â0.001). H2AXhigh LMS tumors showed upregulation of cell cycle-related pathways, while H2AXlow LMS exhibited increased inflammatory activity, including elevated M1 macrophage signatures and resting mast cell signatures (both pâ<â0.001). High Î³-H2AX protein levels were an independent negative prognostic factor in the total LMS cohort (HR 12.12, pâ=â0.025) and in the subgroup of non-uterine LMS (HR 153.80, pâ=â0.013).

However, the recent diagnostic innovations (CINSARC gene-expression signature and tertiary lymphoid structure [TLS]) and therapeutic innovations (immune checkpoint inhibitors [ICIs]) for STS patients underscore the need to re-assess the role of 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Thus, in this correspondence, our objective was to investigate the correlations between STS metabolism as assessed by nuclear imaging, and the immune landscape as estimated by transcriptomics analysis, immunohistochemistry panels, and TLS assessment. Based on a prospective cohort of 85 adult patients with high-grade STS recruited in the NEOSARCOMICS trial (NCT02789384), we identified 3 metabolic groups according to 18F-FDG-PET/CT metrics (metabolic-low [60%], -intermediate [15.3%] and high [24.7%]). We found that T-cells CD8 pathway was significantly enriched in metabolic-high STS. Conversely, several pathways involved in antitumor immune response, cell differentiation and cell cycle, were downregulated in extreme metabolic-low STS. Next, multiplex immunofluorescence showed that densities of CD8+, CD14+, CD45+, CD68+, and c-MAF cells were significantly higher in the metabolic-high group compared to the metabolic-low group. Lastly, no association was found between metabolic group and TLS status. Overall, these results suggest that (i) rapidly proliferating and metabolically active STS can instigate a more robust immune response, thereby attracting immune cells such as T cells and macrophages, and (ii) metabolic activity and TLS could independently influence immune responses.",

The treatment of HCC is complicated by the fact that, in the majority of cases, it develops on a background of advanced chronic inflammatory liver disease. Chronic inflammation can foster an immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes tumour progression and metastasis. In this setting, macrophages make up a major immune component of the HCC tumour microenvironment, and in this review, we focus on their contribution to HCC development and progression. Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are largely derived from infiltrating monocytes and their potent anti-inflammatory phenotype can be induced by factors that are found within the tumour microenvironment, such as growth factors, cytokines, hypoxia, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In general, experimental evidence suggest that TAMs can exhibit a variety of functions that aid HCC tumour progression, including the promotion of angiogenesis, resistance to drug therapy, and releasing factors that support tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. Despite their tumour-promoting profile, there is evidence that the underlying plasticity of these cells can be targeted to help reprogramme TAMs to drive tumour-specific immune responses. We discuss the potential for targeting TAMs therapeutically either by altering their phenotype within the HCC microenvironment or by cell therapy approaches by taking advantage of their infiltrative properties from the circulation into tumour tissue.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>Kaposiâs sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a Î³-herpesvirus, is predominantly associated with Kaposiâs sarcoma (KS) as well as two lymphoproliferative disorders: primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman disease (MCD). Like other herpesviruses, KSHV employs two distinct life cycles: latency and lytic replication. To establish a lifelong persistent infection, KSHV has evolved various strategies to manipulate the epigenetic machinery of the host. In latently infected cells, most viral genes are epigenetically silenced by components of cellular chromatin, DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications. However, some specific latent genes are preserved and actively expressed to maintain the virusâs latent state within the host cell. Latency is not a dead end, but the virus has the ability to reactivate. This reactivation is a complex process that involves the removal of repressive chromatin modifications and increased accessibility for both viral and cellular factors, allowing the activation of the full transcriptional program necessary for the subsequent lytic replication. This review will introduce the roles of epigenetic modifications in KSHV latent and lytic life cycles, including DNA methylation, histone methylation and acetylation modifications, chromatin remodeling, genome conformation, and non-coding RNA expression. Additionally, we will also review the transcriptional regulation of viral genes and host factors in KSHV infection. This review aims to enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic modifications and transcriptional regulation in the KSHV life cycle, providing insights for future research.</p>",

Despite our advances in developing targeted therapies for treating solid malignancies, broad acting chemotherapies remain the first line treatment for OS. In assaying the efficacy of approved therapeutics for non-OS malignancies, we previously identified the histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and 2) inhibitor, romidepsin, as effective for the treatment of established lung metastatic OS. Yet, romidepsin has noted toxicities in humans and so here we aimed to define the primary mechanisms through which HDAC1/2 mediate OS progression to identify more selective druggable targets/pathways. Microarray and proteomics analyses of romidepsin treated OS cells revealed a significant suppression of neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a known regulator of cancer cell migration and invasion. Silencing of NRP1 significantly reduced OS proliferation, migration, invasion and adhesion in vitro. More strikingly, in vivo, reduced NRP1 expression significantly mitigated the lung metastatic potential of OS in two independent models (K7M2 and SAOS-LM7). Mechanistically, our data point to NRP1 mediating this effect via the down regulation of migration machinery, namely SRC, FAK and ROCK1 expression/activity, that is in part, related to NRP1 interaction with integrin beta 1 (ITGB1). In summary, our data indicate that romidepsin down regulation of NRP1 significantly mitigates the ability of OS cells to seed the lung and establish metastases, and that targeting NRP1 or its effectors with selective inhibitors may be a viable means with which to prevent this deadly aspect of the disease.",

Given that both migration and proliferation are enhanced with the loss of LKB1 activity combined with the prevalence of <italic>STK11</italic> genetic alterations in cancer biopsies, LKB1 was marked as a tumor suppressor. However, the role of LKB1 in tumorigenesis is paradoxical as LKB1 activates autophagy and reactive oxygen species scavenging while dampening anoikis, which contribute to cancer cell survival.

With the recent successes of targeting LKB1 signaling in research and clinical settings, and enhanced cytotoxicity of chemical compounds in LKB1-deficient tumors, there is now a need for LKB1 inhibitors. However, validating LKB1 inhibitors is challenging as LKB1 adaptor proteins, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and splice variants all manipulate LKB1 activity. Furthermore, STE-20-related kinase adaptor protein (STRAD) and mouse protein 25 dictate LKB1 cellular localization and kinase activity. For these reasons, prior to assessing the efficacy and potency of pharmacological candidates, the functional status of LKB1 needs to be defined.

Both advanced age and obesity are among the most important risk factors for the development of cancer. We observed that patients with cancer predisposition syndromes due to mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 exhibit abnormally high plasma DBI/ACBP levels. Additionally, patients without known cancer predisposition syndromes also manifest higher DBI/ACBP levels before imminent cancer diagnosis (within 0-3âyears) as compared to age and BMI-matched controls who remain cancer-free. Thus, supranormal plasma DBI/ACBP constitutes a risk factor for later cancer development. Mouse experimentation revealed that genetic or antibody-mediated DBI/ACBP inhibition can delay the development or progression of cancers. In the context of chemoimmunotherapy, DBI/ACBP neutralization enhances tumor infiltration by non-exhausted effector T cells but reduces infiltration by regulatory T cells. This resulted in better cancer control in models of breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and sarcoma.

This increasing burden highlights ongoing challenges in cancer treatment despite significant advances that have reduced cancer mortality by 31% since 1991. Key obstacles include the diseaseâs inherent heterogeneity and complexity, such as treatment resistance, cancer stem cells, and the multifaceted tumor microenvironment (TME). The TMEâcomprising various tumor and immune cells, blood vessels, and biochemical factorsâplays a crucial role in tumor growth and resistance to therapies. Recent innovations in cancer treatment, particularly in the field of immuno-oncology, have leveraged insights into TME interactions. An emerging example is the FDA-approved therapy using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), demonstrating the potential of cell-based approaches in solid tumors. However, TIL therapy is just one of many strategies being explored. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of immuno-oncology, focusing on how novel therapies targeting or harnessing components of the TME could enhance treatment efficacy and address persistent challenges in cancer care.</p>",
