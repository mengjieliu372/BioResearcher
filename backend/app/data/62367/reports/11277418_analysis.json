    "Part 1": {
        "Title": "Identification and Evaluation of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) in Liposarcoma and Normal Adipose Tissues",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "This part is well-aligned with the research objective to classify the immune microenvironment and identify key genes in liposarcoma, focusing on transcriptomics. It provides a strong basis for understanding gene expression differences between tumor and normal tissues.",
        "Suggestions": "You can refer to the datasets GSE21122, GSE159659, GSE30929, and GSE159848 for comparison with your data. Additionally, methods like GEO2R for DEG identification can be directly applied in your research. Enhance the focus on how identified DEGs may relate to immune response mechanisms and their potential roles in the immune microenvironment."
    },
    "Part 2": {
        "Title": "Development of a Six-Gene Prognostic Signature by Screening of DRFS-Related DEGs",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "While this part focuses on prognostic signatures, a stronger emphasis on immune-related gene expression would better align with your primary objective of understanding the immune microenvironment.",
        "Suggestions": "Modify the Lasso Cox regression approach to focus on immune-related genes instead of solely prognostic factors. Use the identified six-gene signature as a reference for exploring immune-related gene expression in your dataset. Clarify how these genes may impact the immune microenvironment in liposarcoma and consider the implications for immune-based therapies."
    },
    "Part 3": {
        "Title": "The Expression Features and Prognostic Values of the Six Signature Genes",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "This section provides valuable insights into gene expression differences but could better align with the focus on the immune microenvironment by emphasizing the roles of these genes in immune responses.",
        "Suggestions": "Utilize methods for expression comparison (e.g., box and violin plots) to analyze immune-related genes in your datasets. Validate findings with immunohistochemistry on your paraffin sections to compare immune cell infiltration. Clearly articulate how these comparisons inform the understanding of immune microenvironment variations and their clinical relevance."
    },
    "Part 4": {
        "Title": "Evaluation of the Prognostic Ability of Six-Gene Signature Indicates That It Is an Independent Predictor for LPS Prognosis",
        "Referability": "Low",
        "Reason": "This part primarily focuses on prognostic analysis rather than immune microenvironment characterization, which is not the main objective of your research.",
        "Suggestions": "Adapt the methods described to evaluate the predictive accuracy of immune-related gene signatures in your dataset. Emphasize how findings could influence therapeutic strategies targeting the immune microenvironment, and discuss potential correlations between immune cell infiltration and prognostic outcomes."
    },
    "Part 5": {
        "Title": "Patients with Different Risk Scores Exhibit Distinct Molecular Subtypes and the Enriched Gene Sets",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "The consensus clustering analysis may provide insights into molecular subtypes related to immune microenvironment variations, but the focus on risk scores may not fully align with your core research objective.",
        "Suggestions": "Adapt the consensus clustering analysis to classify patients based on immune cell profiling rather than risk scores. Use GSEA to explore immune-related pathways that may be enriched in different molecular subtypes, ensuring that the focus remains on the immune characteristics relevant to your research."
    },
    "Part 6": {
        "Title": "Immune Landscape Characterization of Risk Model Reveals Significant Differences in Immune Microenvironment between High- and Low-Risk Patients",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "This part directly addresses the immune microenvironment, providing methods for immune cell infiltration analysis that are central to your research objective.",
        "Suggestions": "Use CIBERSORTx to estimate immune cell proportions in your samples and correlate these with the expression of key genes identified in your study. Detail how these immune characteristics influence outcomes in liposarcoma patients and discuss their implications for potential immunotherapies."
    },
    "Part 7": {
        "Title": "Elucidation of the Therapeutic Significance of the Prognostic Signature to LPS Patients",
        "Referability": "Low",
        "Reason": "This section focuses on therapeutic implications and drug target correlations, which may not directly contribute to your primary focus on the immune microenvironment.",
        "Suggestions": "While the therapeutic implications may not be a primary focus, consider how the identified immune-related genes could correlate with known drug targets in liposarcoma therapies. Explore potential immunotherapy responses based on the immune landscape characterized in your findings and discuss how this could inform personalized treatment strategies."
