Suggestions for future research to explore the combined potential of TLS status and PET/CT imaging as predictors of STS patient responsiveness to ICIs:\\n   A. Future studies should investigate the interplay between TLS status (assessed in all patients) and metabolic activity (evaluated through 18F-FDG-PET/CT) as potential predictive biomarkers for patient responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Specifically, research could explore whether the presence of TLS correlates with enhanced immune infiltration in metabolic-high tumors.\\n   B. Exploring this combined potential could lead to more effective treatment strategies for STS patients, potentially improving response rates and survival outcomes, as there was no association found between metabolic groups and TLS status in the current study, as discussed in Supplementary Table T5.\\n   C.
