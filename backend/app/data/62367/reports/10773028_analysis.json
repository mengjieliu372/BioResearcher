        "Title": "Correlation of Metabolic Activity and Immune Landscape in STS: A Study Using 18F-FDG-PET/CT and Transcriptomics",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "This part provides insights into the correlation between metabolic activity and the immune landscape, which can be applicable to liposarcoma. However, the focus on soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) and the specific use of 18F-FDG-PET/CT may not directly translate to liposarcoma, which may have different metabolic characteristics.",
        "Suggestions": "You can reference the methods used for correlating metabolic activity with immune responses and consider adapting the statistical analysis methods (e.g., Spearman correlation coefficients, differential expression analysis with DESeq2). Clarify how imaging data can complement transcriptomic analysis, focusing on how metabolic profiling can be tailored to the characteristics of liposarcoma."
    },
    "Part 2": {
        "Title": "Metabolic Profiles According to 18F-FDG-PET/CT Correlate with the Immune Landscape of STS",
        "Referability": "Low",
        "Reason": "This part focuses heavily on 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging metrics and specific patient groups that may not align with the available resources in your research, particularly since you are working with RNA sequencing data rather than imaging data.",
        "Suggestions": "Adapt the patient recruitment and characteristics approach to focus on available RNA sequencing data. Modify the methodology to exclude imaging metrics and instead emphasize transcriptomic analysis, highlighting how these insights can deepen understanding of the immune landscape in liposarcoma."
    },
    "Part 3": {
        "Title": "Transcriptomic Characteristics of the Metabolic Groups",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "This part discusses RNA sequencing data analysis and differential gene expression, which are directly aligned with your objective of analyzing transcriptomics in liposarcoma. It provides relevant methodologies for data analysis that can be directly applied to your research.",
        "Suggestions": "Utilize RNA sequencing analysis techniques outlined, such as quality control metrics and DESeq2 for differential expression analysis. Connect the analysis more explicitly to how findings from related literature inform your approach to transcriptomic analysis and patient stratification. Include specific examples of previous studies that have shaped your research questions and methodologies."
    },
    "Part 4": {
        "Title": "Validation of Immune Pathway Expression at the Protein Level Using Immunohistochemistry",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "Although the techniques discussed are relevant for validating findings at the protein level, the focus on specific immune markers and protocols may require adaptation for liposarcoma-specific markers.",
        "Suggestions": "Refer to immunohistochemistry methods and adapt them to validate key genes identified in your transcriptomic analysis. Ensure that the chosen markers are relevant to liposarcoma, aligning the validation process with the immune pathways identified in your transcriptomic analysis."
    },
    "Part 5": {
        "Title": "Conclusion and Future Directions",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "While the conclusions regarding metabolic activity and immune cell infiltration may provide insights, the specific context of soft-tissue sarcomas could limit direct application to liposarcoma.",
        "Suggestions": "Use the discussion on implications for patient stratification and treatment strategies to develop your conclusions based on findings from your liposarcoma research. Suggest future research directions that investigate specific immune pathways in liposarcoma and explore how metabolic profiling can enhance predictions of responses to immunotherapy."
