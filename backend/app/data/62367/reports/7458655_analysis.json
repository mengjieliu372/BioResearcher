        "Title": "Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Sarcoma Patients",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "The demographic and clinical characteristics of sarcoma patients provide useful context, but the focus should be specifically on liposarcoma to ensure relevance to my research objective.",
        "Suggestions": "I will modify the demographic criteria to specifically include liposarcoma patients while discussing how patient demographics may influence immune responses and treatment outcomes unique to liposarcoma."
    },
    "Part 2": {
        "Title": "Immune Landscape Analysis of Sarcomas",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "The analysis of the immune landscape is directly relevant to my research objective, which involves identifying key genes associated with the immune microenvironment in liposarcoma.",
        "Suggestions": "I will focus specifically on immune markers relevant to liposarcoma and utilize my RNA-seq data. Additionally, I will include a discussion on the implications of specific immune markers for potential immunotherapy strategies tailored to liposarcoma."
    },
    "Part 3": {
        "Title": "Gene Expression Patterns Across Sarcoma Subtypes",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "The differential expression analysis of immune-related genes aligns closely with my objective of characterizing the immune microenvironment in liposarcoma.",
        "Suggestions": "I will adopt the differential expression analysis techniques and statistical evaluations, focusing solely on liposarcoma samples and including genes specifically relevant to liposarcoma. Furthermore, I will discuss how these gene expression patterns may influence treatment outcomes in liposarcoma patients."
    },
    "Part 4": {
        "Title": "Prognostic Impact of Immune Checkpoint and Membrane Marker Genes",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "This section discusses prognostic impacts in sarcoma subtypes, which may not provide direct insights for liposarcoma. However, the statistical methods for evaluating prognostic significance could be beneficial.",
        "Suggestions": "I will adapt the methods for evaluating the prognostic impact of specific genes to focus on liposarcoma-related markers. I will also discuss how the prognostic indicators can inform treatment decisions specific to liposarcoma."
    },
    "Part 5": {
        "Title": "Prognostic Implications of Immune Cell Composition as Assessed by CIBERSORT",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "The application of CIBERSORT to analyze immune cell populations is highly relevant for characterizing the immune microenvironment in liposarcoma.",
        "Suggestions": "I will use the CIBERSORT method to analyze my RNA sequencing data, focusing on liposarcoma samples. I will also explore correlations between immune cell populations and liposarcoma-specific outcomes and discuss potential therapeutic implications based on these findings."
