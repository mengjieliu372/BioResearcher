Use the 'TMM' (Trimmed Mean of M-values) method available in the edgeR package for normalization. Load raw count data from the supplementary file 'GSE202361_AllSamples_rawcount.txt.gz' from dataset ID GSE202361, which contains RNA sequencing data of sarcoma tumor tissues. This file should be unzipped and imported into the analysis environment. Ensure to check the quality of the raw counts and filter out low-quality genes with low counts across samples (e.g., keep genes with at least 10 counts in at least 3 samples).\n\nIdentify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between liposarcoma tissues and normal adipose tissues using GEO2R. Upload the normalized data to GEO2R, select the appropriate comparison groups (liposarcoma vs. normal adipose), and set the following parameters: p-value cutoff at 0.05 and log2 fold change cutoff at 1. Use the 'Multi-Comparison' option to visualize results. Review the results to extract DEGs with significant changes in expression, and export the list of DEGs in a suitable format (e.g., CSV or Excel).\n\nConduct functional annotation of DEGs using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources. Input the list of DEGs obtained from step 2 into the DAVID tool. Select the following parameters: species as 'Homo sapiens', and use the 'Functional Annotation Chart' to identify biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components associated with the DEGs. Additionally, explore the 'Gene Ontology' options to gain insights into the functional implications of the identified DEGs. Export the results for further analysis.\n\nPerform pathway enrichment analysis using the KEGG database. Input the DEGs from step 2 into the KEGG pathway analysis tool. Set the parameters: p-value threshold at 0.05, and adjust for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Review the pathways identified as significantly enriched, and note key pathways associated with liposarcoma. Additionally, consider using the Reactome database as an alternative resource for pathway analysis.\n\nIntegrate findings from steps 1-4 into a comprehensive report that discusses the immune microenvironment in liposarcoma. Highlight how DEGs relate to immune functions, identify specific immune markers, and relate these findings to previously published studies. Discuss implications for future research and clinical applications, and suggest potential experimental modifications based on preliminary findings, such as exploring different DEGs or pathways in subsequent analyses.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 1 of experimental protocol.

Extract relevant samples based on immune response characteristics, particularly focusing on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. For data extraction, ensure to preprocess the raw count data, applying quality control steps like filtering low-quality reads and normalizing the data. Include samples with both treated and untreated conditions for comprehensive analysis. The following preprocessing steps should be applied: remove duplicates, trim low-quality bases, and apply suitable normalization methods such as TMM (Trimmed Mean of M-values).\n\nPerform differential gene expression analysis focusing on immune-related genes using the DESeq2 package. Load the count data from GSE202361 and GSE205492. Design the experiment matrix to compare tumor samples against normal adipose tissues. Set parameters for DESeq2 to include an alpha value of 0.05 for statistical significance and consider a log2 fold change threshold of 1.0 to identify significantly differentially expressed immune-related genes. Use the default normalization method of DESeq2, which accounts for size factors, and specify the model formula as ~ condition to assess the effect of the condition on gene expression.\n\nConduct gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify immune pathways relevant to liposarcoma.

Set the minimum gene set size to 15 and the maximum to 500 for the analysis. Apply the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.25 to determine significance in pathway enrichment. Additionally, perform a robustness check by running GSEA with permutations to assess the stability of the results.\n\nCompare the findings from the GSEA with existing datasets like GSE243904 and GSE243759 to validate the identified immune pathways.

Each task corresponds to a specific dry experimental step, and the inputs and outputs are relevant to the tasks described in the protocol.\n- However, there are minor discrepancies in the specificity of some inputs and outputs. For instance, the description of the input for GSEA could specify the exact format of the gene list (e.g., a CSV file or a specific data structure) to enhance clarity.\n\n**Detail: 4/5**\n- The extraction captures the essential steps of the experimental protocol, including data analysis, preprocessing, and comparisons. Each task is clearly defined, and the expected outputs are articulated.\n- Some areas could benefit from additional detail. For example, the preprocessing step could specify the exact criteria for filtering low-quality reads and the specific normalization method used (e.g., TMM) in more detail. Additionally, the output of the GSEA could include more specific metrics, such as the number of pathways identified or the top pathways ranked by significance.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n1. **Input and Output Specificity**: \n   - Enhance the descriptions of inputs and outputs by including specific formats, types, and any relevant parameters. For example, specify the format of the count data (e.g., matrix, data frame) and the expected structure of the output files (e.g., CSV, JSON).\n\n2. **Clarification of Preprocessing Steps**:\n   - Provide more detailed criteria for quality control steps, such as the thresholds for filtering low-quality reads and the specific methods used for trimming bases.\n\n3. **GSEA Output Details**:\n   - Include more comprehensive details in the GSEA output, such as the number of pathways analyzed, the top pathways identified, and their respective enrichment scores.\n\n4. **Consistency in Terminology**:\n   - Ensure consistent use of terminology throughout the extraction. For instance, if \"immune-related genes\" is used in one task, it should be consistently referred to in the same way in all relevant tasks.\n\n5. **Integration of Clinical Data**:\n   - When discussing the integration of immune markers, specify how clinical outcomes will be measured or defined, which would provide a clearer context for the analysis.\n\n### Final Integral Score\n[4]"

Adjust for potential confounding factors such as age, sex, and treatment type using multivariate regression analysis. For the analyses, R (version 4.0 or later) and the 'psych' package will be utilized.\n\nExplore potential immunotherapy strategies based on immune microenvironment characteristics. Review the findings from previous parts to identify immune markers and cell types that correlated with improved patient outcomes. Conduct a literature review focusing on the response of liposarcoma to immunotherapies targeting PD-1, CTLA-4, and other relevant immune checkpoints, referencing studies such as those by Smith et al. (2020) and Johnson et al. (2021). Propose a set of candidate immunotherapy strategies based on the identified immune markers and their prognostic implications.\n\nIntegrate findings into a comprehensive risk model for liposarcoma patients. Use the immune markers and cell composition results from previous analyses to develop a multivariate prognostic model. Perform statistical modeling using Cox proportional hazards regression, ensuring to include immune markers, clinical data, and relevant covariates. Evaluate the model's performance using concordance index (C-index) and calibration plots. Stratify patients based on risk scores derived from the model to evaluate differences in survival outcomes. The 'survival' and 'rms' packages in R (version 4.0 or later) will be utilized for this analysis.\n\nDiscuss how these findings can inform future clinical applications and treatment strategies. Summarize the key findings regarding immune microenvironment characteristics and their prognostic implications. Highlight the potential for personalized immunotherapy based on identified immune markers. Discuss future directions for research that may include clinical trials targeting the identified immune pathways in liposarcoma patients and how these strategies could improve patient outcomes. Reference guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for the integration of these findings into clinical practice.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 5 of experimental protocol.
