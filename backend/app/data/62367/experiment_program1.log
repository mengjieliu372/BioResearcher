Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}, 'GSE21122': {'Status': 'Public on Jul 06, 2010', 'Title': 'Whole-transcript expression data for soft-tissue sarcoma tumors and control normal fat specimens', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Experiment type': 'Expression profiling by array', 'Summary': 'Soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive mesenchymal cancers that affect more than 10,600 new patients per year in the US, about 40% of whom will die of their disease. Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}, 'GSE21122': {'Status': 'Public on Jul 06, 2010', 'Title': 'Whole-transcript expression data for soft-tissue sarcoma tumors and control normal fat specimens', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Experiment type': 'Expression profiling by array', 'Summary': 'Soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive mesenchymal cancers that affect more than 10,600 new patients per year in the US, about 40% of whom will die of their disease. Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}, 'GSE21122': {'Status': 'Public on Jul 06, 2010', 'Title': 'Whole-transcript expression data for soft-tissue sarcoma tumors and control normal fat specimens', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Experiment type': 'Expression profiling by array', 'Summary': 'Soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive mesenchymal cancers that affect more than 10,600 new patients per year in the US, about 40% of whom will die of their disease. Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.

Human cells were washed with PBS and staining buffer, and then incubated with Fc receptor blocking solution for 15 minutes. Cells were stained with the following fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies: CD3-FITC, CD56-PE, CD45-BV510 and CD8-BV785. Live/dead staining was performed using Fixable Viability Dye 780. Data were acquired using a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo Software. Fluorescence-associated cell sorting (FACS) was performed using a BD inFlux cell sorter. Cells were sorted for blood and intra-tumoral NK cells (live CD45+CD3-CD56+), blood and intra-tumoral T cells (live CD45+CD3+CD56-), and tumor cells (live CD45-). Following FACS isolation, cells were cryopreserved and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extraction and sequencing. Cells were processed for RNA isolation using the Total RNA Purification Plus Micro Kit.RNAseq libraries were prepared by the University of California, Davis, Bioinformatics Core. Gene expression profiling was carried out using a 3'-Tag-RNA-Seq protocol. Up to forty-eight libraries were sequenced per lane on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer with single-end 100 base pair reads. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with the DESeq2 package for R. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to adjust for False Discovery Rate (FDR).\", 'Library strategy': 'RNA-Seq', 'Library source': 'transcriptomic', 'Instrument model': 'Illumina HiSeq 4000', 'Data processing': 'Read Count with DGEList (Edge R)Preprocessing and normalization factors in EdgeR/limmaLog transformed normalized expression with CPM functionVoom transformation and calculation of variance weights, filtering linear models in limmaAssembly: GRCh 38Supplementary files format and content: Excel file', 'Platform ID': 'GPL20301'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE205492_rnaseq_workshop_normalized_counts.txt.gz', 'file_size': '942.8 Kb', 'file_type': 'TXT', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE205492&format=file&file=GSE205492%5Frnaseq%5Fworkshop%5Fnormalized%5Fcounts%2Etxt%2Egz'}]}, 'GSE243904': {'Status': 'Public on Sep 25, 2023', 'Title': 'Antitumor effects of PRMT5 inhibition in sarcomas [RNA-seq]', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Experiment type': 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing', 'Summary': 'Patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs) have few therapeutic options. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported. To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.

In all cohorts, hLMS were preferentially carried by women, located in the internal trunk, highly differentiated, and similarly altered at the genomic level. Based on integrative bioinformatic analysis, we show that hLMS originate from vascular smooth muscle cells presenting both contractile and synthetic characteristics, while oLMS could derive from fibroblasts. We found strong MYOCD expression to be an hLMS-specific driver and show that the MYOCD/SRF axis is essential only for hLMS survival. Identification of hLMS could become standard clinical practice, leading to the development of specific effective treatments with MYOCD/SRF inhibitors.', 'Overall design': '50 mixoid liposarcomas hybridized to Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL6480, Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)', 'Samples': {'GSM4848353': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM4848353', 'name': 'mLPS1', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM4848353_053135_DY769_1_2.txt.gz', 'file_size': '1.9 Mb', 'file_type': 'TXT', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM4848353&format=file&file=GSM4848353%5F053135%5FDY769%5F1%5F2%2Etxt%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Dec 31, 2022', 'Title': 'mLPS1', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'Sex: Mage: 44subject status/id: mixoid liposarcoma patient 1metastasis: 0time_mfs: 9.78630136986301os: 0time_os: 9.78630136986301location: Extremitiesgrade: 1differentiation: 2', 'Treatment protocol': 'Frozen tissue', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA were extracted from frozen tumor samples using the miRNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen) and purified using the RNeasy® Min Elute TM Cleanup Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s procedures.

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}, 'GSE21122': {'Status': 'Public on Jul 06, 2010', 'Title': 'Whole-transcript expression data for soft-tissue sarcoma tumors and control normal fat specimens', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Experiment type': 'Expression profiling by array', 'Summary': 'Soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive mesenchymal cancers that affect more than 10,600 new patients per year in the US, about 40% of whom will die of their disease. Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.

Based on integrative bioinformatic analysis, we show that hLMS originate from vascular smooth muscle cells presenting both contractile and synthetic characteristics, while oLMS could derive from fibroblasts.

Liposarcoma is classified into 5 histologic subtypes that fall into 3 biological groups characterized by specific genetic alterations. To identify genes that contribute to liposarcomagenesis and to better predict outcome for patients with the disease, we undertook expression profiling of liposarcoma. U133A expression profiling was performed on 140 primary liposarcoma samples, which were randomly split into training set (n=95) and test set (n=45). A multi-gene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed using the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% vs. 45% for high risk score patients (P=0.001). The hazard ratio for high vs. low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% confidence interval 1.26-15.55; P=0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732.  Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multi-gene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis. Thus, genes identified from this predictor appear to have roles in liposarcomagenesis and have promise as therapeutic targets. In addition, the multi-gene predictor will improve risk stratification for individual patients with liposarcoma.', 'Overall design': \"140 human liposarcoma specimens were profiled on Affymetrix U133A arrays per manufacturer's instructions.\", 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL96, [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array', 'Samples': {'GSM766533': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM766533', 'name': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM766533.CEL.gz', 'file_size': '3.4 Mb', 'file_type': 'CEL', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM766533&format=file&file=GSM766533%2ECEL%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 02, 2011', 'Title': 'Sarcoma tumor DD0728', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'tissue: primary liposarcomasubtype: dedifferentiatedsample id: DD0728trainingtest: Trainingdrfs: FALSEtt.drfs: 32.95', 'Treatment protocol': 'None.', 'Growth protocol': 'None.', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'Total RNA was extracted from macro-dissected cryomolds and homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent.', 'Description': 'Soft-tissue sarcomaRe-analysis of GSM528276', 'Data processing': 'Signal intensity was generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software, and expression was estimated with robust multi-array average (RMA).', 'Platform ID': 'GPL96'}}, 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSE30929_RAW.tar', 'file_size': '477.0 Mb', 'file_type': 'TAR (of CEL)', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSE30929&format=file'}]}, 'GSE21122': {'Status': 'Public on Jul 06, 2010', 'Title': 'Whole-transcript expression data for soft-tissue sarcoma tumors and control normal fat specimens', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Experiment type': 'Expression profiling by array', 'Summary': 'Soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive mesenchymal cancers that affect more than 10,600 new patients per year in the US, about 40% of whom will die of their disease. Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes, but our knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. Here we describe the results of an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number, and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Genes mutated in more than 5% of samples within a subtype were KIT (in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, or GISTs), TP53 (pleomorphic liposarcomas), PIK3CA (myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma), and NF1 (both myxofibrosarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma). We show evidence that PIK3CA mutations, found in 18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, activate AKT in vivo and are associated with poor outcomes. Point mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were discovered in both myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, while genomic deletions were observed in all subtypes at varying frequencies. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of a subset of genes that are amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation.
