FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort.

To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

While the presence of FUS-DDIT3 as a driver oncoprotein in most MLS cases has been confirmed, the exact molecular action behind the capacity of FUS-DDIT3 for transformation is still unclear and therefore creates a challenge in finding new treatments against this type of cancer. The importance of the microenvironment for tumor progression have long been accepted and might also influence the effect of the fusion oncoprotein. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in myxoid liposarcoma development. Therefore, we have developed a new model system utilizing scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that are decellularized and then repopulated with sarcoma cell lines. This cell culture system mimics in vivo-like tumor cell growth conditions and induce transcriptional changes within the cells. In order to investigate the effect of the microenvironment as well as the fusion oncogene, we analyzed myxoid liposarcoma cell lines as well as fibrosarcoma cells with and without ectopic FUS-DDIT3 expression cultured in scaffolds and adherent two-dimensional growth conditions. We identified several gene networks and processes that are uniquely associated with FUS-DDIT3 expression and with the microenvironment, respectively.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort.

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

FUS-DDIT3 is causative in tumor development, but the molecular function of FUS-DDIT3 remains largely unknown. In addition, the tumor microenvironment is important in MLS development. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in MLS development. Therefore, we have developed an in vivo-like experimental model system utilizing cell-free scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that can be repopulated with tumor cells.

While the presence of FUS-DDIT3 as a driver oncoprotein in most MLS cases has been confirmed, the exact molecular action behind the capacity of FUS-DDIT3 for transformation is still unclear and therefore creates a challenge in finding new treatments against this type of cancer. The importance of the microenvironment for tumor progression have long been accepted and might also influence the effect of the fusion oncoprotein. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in myxoid liposarcoma development. Therefore, we have developed a new model system utilizing scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that are decellularized and then repopulated with sarcoma cell lines. This cell culture system mimics in vivo-like tumor cell growth conditions and induce transcriptional changes within the cells.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort.

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort.

In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth.

High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients.

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort.

In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth.

High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients.
