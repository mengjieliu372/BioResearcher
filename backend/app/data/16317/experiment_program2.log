FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported. To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production. The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported.  To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays.  High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.  The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS.

However, it could benefit from more specific parameters regarding the sample size and the exact methods used for histological analysis and immunohistochemistry. For instance, specifying the number of sections to be cut for histological analysis and the exact protocols for staining would enhance reproducibility.\n\n2. **Factual Reliability (Score: 5)**  \n   The information provided appears accurate and reliable, with references to established datasets (TCGA and GTEx) and recognized methods for histological analysis. The use of specific antibodies and their dilutions adds to the factual reliability of the protocol.\n\n3. **Relevance (Score: 5)**  \n   The protocol aligns well with the research objectives of characterizing the immune microenvironment in liposarcoma. The steps outlined directly contribute to understanding the tumor characteristics and immune cell infiltration, which are critical for the research goals.\n\n4. **Referability and Modifications (Score: 4)**  \n   The protocol includes references to previous reports, which is beneficial for referability. However, it could improve by explicitly stating how modifications can be made based on preliminary findings or specific experimental conditions. For example, it could suggest alternative antibodies or staining methods if initial results are inconclusive.\n\n5. **Logical Structure (Score: 4)**  \n   The protocol is logically structured, with clear steps that follow a coherent flow from sample selection to characterization. However, the transition between steps could be improved by explicitly stating how the outcomes of one step inform the next. For instance, after histological analysis, it could clarify how the results will guide the selection of immune markers for immunohistochemistry.\n\n### Areas for Improvement and Modification Suggestions\n\n- **Detail Level:**  \n  - Specify the exact number of tumor and normal samples to be collected from TCGA and GTEx.\n  - Include detailed protocols for histological analysis, such as the thickness of tissue sections and the specific steps for H&E staining.\n  - Provide a clear outline of the immunohistochemistry protocol, including incubation times and temperatures.\n\n- **Factual Reliability:**  \n  - Ensure that all antibodies listed are accompanied by their respective catalog numbers and sources to facilitate procurement.\n  - Include references to the latest guidelines or publications that validate the chosen methods.\n\n- **Relevance:**  \n  - Consider adding a brief rationale for the selection of specific immune markers based on current literature to strengthen the relevance of the chosen methods.\n\n- **Referability and Modifications:**  \n  - Include a section on troubleshooting common issues encountered during sample collection and analysis, along with potential modifications based on preliminary results.\n  - Suggest alternative methods or markers that could be used if initial findings do not meet expectations.\n\n- **Logical Structure:**  \n  - Improve transitions between steps by summarizing how the results from one step will influence the next. For example, after histological grading, explain how this will affect the selection of samples for immune profiling.\n\nFinal Integral Score: [4.2]"

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort.

To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

FUS-DDIT3 is causative in tumor development, but the molecular function of FUS-DDIT3 remains largely unknown. In addition, the tumor microenvironment is important in MLS development. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in MLS development. Therefore, we have developed an in vivo-like experimental model system utilizing cell-free scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that can be repopulated with tumor cells.

While the presence of FUS-DDIT3 as a driver oncoprotein in most MLS cases has been confirmed, the exact molecular action behind the capacity of FUS-DDIT3 for transformation is still unclear and therefore creates a challenge in finding new treatments against this type of cancer. The importance of the microenvironment for tumor progression have long been accepted and might also influence the effect of the fusion oncoprotein. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in myxoid liposarcoma development. Therefore, we have developed a new model system utilizing scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that are decellularized and then repopulated with sarcoma cell lines. This cell culture system mimics in vivo-like tumor cell growth conditions and induce transcriptional changes within the cells.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort.

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

FUS-DDIT3 is causative in tumor development, but the molecular function of FUS-DDIT3 remains largely unknown. In addition, the tumor microenvironment is important in MLS development. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in MLS development. Therefore, we have developed an in vivo-like experimental model system utilizing cell-free scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that can be repopulated with tumor cells.

While the presence of FUS-DDIT3 as a driver oncoprotein in most MLS cases has been confirmed, the exact molecular action behind the capacity of FUS-DDIT3 for transformation is still unclear and therefore creates a challenge in finding new treatments against this type of cancer. The importance of the microenvironment for tumor progression have long been accepted and might also influence the effect of the fusion oncoprotein. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in myxoid liposarcoma development. Therefore, we have developed a new model system utilizing scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that are decellularized and then repopulated with sarcoma cell lines. This cell culture system mimics in vivo-like tumor cell growth conditions and induce transcriptional changes within the cells.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort.

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

FUS-DDIT3 is causative in tumor development, but the molecular function of FUS-DDIT3 remains largely unknown. In addition, the tumor microenvironment is important in MLS development. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in MLS development. Therefore, we have developed an in vivo-like experimental model system utilizing cell-free scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that can be repopulated with tumor cells.

While the presence of FUS-DDIT3 as a driver oncoprotein in most MLS cases has been confirmed, the exact molecular action behind the capacity of FUS-DDIT3 for transformation is still unclear and therefore creates a challenge in finding new treatments against this type of cancer. The importance of the microenvironment for tumor progression have long been accepted and might also influence the effect of the fusion oncoprotein. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in myxoid liposarcoma development. Therefore, we have developed a new model system utilizing scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that are decellularized and then repopulated with sarcoma cell lines. This cell culture system mimics in vivo-like tumor cell growth conditions and induce transcriptional changes within the cells.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort.

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

FUS-DDIT3 is causative in tumor development, but the molecular function of FUS-DDIT3 remains largely unknown. In addition, the tumor microenvironment is important in MLS development. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in MLS development. Therefore, we have developed an in vivo-like experimental model system utilizing cell-free scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that can be repopulated with tumor cells.

While the presence of FUS-DDIT3 as a driver oncoprotein in most MLS cases has been confirmed, the exact molecular action behind the capacity of FUS-DDIT3 for transformation is still unclear and therefore creates a challenge in finding new treatments against this type of cancer. The importance of the microenvironment for tumor progression have long been accepted and might also influence the effect of the fusion oncoprotein. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in myxoid liposarcoma development. Therefore, we have developed a new model system utilizing scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that are decellularized and then repopulated with sarcoma cell lines. This cell culture system mimics in vivo-like tumor cell growth conditions and induce transcriptional changes within the cells.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort.
