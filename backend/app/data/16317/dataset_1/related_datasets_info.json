        "Summary": "Recent evidence suggests that immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has some activity in metastatic dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS). We conducted a randomized, non-comparative phase 2 trial (NCT03307616) of nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab in patients with resectable retroperitoneal DDLPS (n=17) and extremity/truncal UPS (n=10), with UPS patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy. The primary endpoint of pathologic response as assessed by percent hyalinization was observed to be a median of 8.8% in DDLPS patients and 89% in UPS patients and similar in nivolumab and ipilimumab/nivolumab arms in both cohorts . Higher intratumoral densities of T-regulatory cells were associated with absence of pathologic response (hyalinization<30%). Tumor infiltration by B-cells was associated with higher densities of T-regulatory cells before treatment;  this association was lost upon ICB treatment. Our data demonstrate that neoadjuvant ICB with concurrent radiation may have significant efficacy in UPS and is associated complex immune changes in the tumor microenvironment in DDLPS and UPS.",

The treated RNA then was cleaned-up using the AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences) and eluted into 1x TE buffer. The purified RNA was quantified using Quant-iT™ RiboGreen™ RNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher SCIENTIFIC) and the RNA quality was accessed using Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit and the 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument (Agilent Technologies).Up to 200 ng of each cDNA sample based on the PicoGreen quantification was sheared (mechanically fragmented) using the E220 Focused-ultrasonicator Covaris (Covaris). The sonication was performed under the following conditions: Peak Incident Power 200, Duty Cycle 25%, Cycles per Burst 50, and duration 10 seconds for 120 iterations. To ensure the proper fragment size, samples were examined on TapeStation 4200 using the DNA High Sensitivity kit (Agilent Technologies). The sheared cDNA was proceeded to library preparation using SureSelect XT Low Input Reagent Kit with indexes 1-96 (Agilent Technologies) as automated method on the Sciclone G3 NGSx Workstation (PerkinElmer, Inc.).This protocol consists of 3 enzymatic reactions for end repair, A-tailing and Adaptor ligation, followed by barcode insertion by PCR using Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase (8 to 14 cycles, based on input DNA quality and quantity). PCR primers were removed by using 1x volume of Agencourt AMPure PCR Purification kit (Agencourt Bioscience Corporation). The quality and quantity of the prepared libraries were evaluated using TapeStation 4200 and the DNA High Sensitivity kit (Agilent Technologies) to verify correct fragment size and to ensure complete removal of primer dimers.",

        "Summary": "FUS-CHOP and EWS-CHOP balanced translocations characterize myxoid liposarcoma which encompasses myxoid (ML) and round cell (RC) variants initially believed to be distinct diseases. Currently, myxoid and RC liposarcoma are regarded to represent the well differentiated and the poorly differentiated ends, respectively, within spectrum of myxoid liposarcoma where the fusion proteins blocking lipogenic differentiation play a role in tumor initiation while molecular determinants associated to progression to RC remain poorly understood. Activation of AKT pathway sustained by PIK3CA and PTEN mutations and growth factor receptor signalling such as RET and IGF1R have been recently correlated with the increasing of aggressiveness and RC.  Aim of the present study is to elucidate molecular events involved in driving round cell progression analyzing two small series of MLS selected to be representative of the two end of the gamut: the pure myxoid (0% of RC component) and RC with high cellular component (≥80%).",
        "Overall design": "The validation series (INT-B) consisted of cryopreserved samples obtained from 12 patients. Six cases were pure myxoid and six were pure RC. The diagnoses were confirmed by means of FISH analysis, which revealed CHOP rearrangement, or by RT-PCR searching for the transcript type. Different molecular variants of the fusion transcript have been described by Powers MP et al. (Mod Pathol. 2010).",

        "Organism": "Homo sapiens",
        "Experiment type": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing",
        "Summary": "Genes encoding the RNA-binding proteins FUS, EWSR1, and TAF15 (FET proteins) are involved in chromosomal translocations in several rare sarcomas. FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas",
        "Overall design": "To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq",

        "Summary": "Myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) is the second most common type of liposarcoma and is characterized by the fusion oncogene FUS‐DDIT3 or the less common EWSR1‐DDIT3. FUS-DDIT3 is causative in tumor development, but the molecular function of FUS-DDIT3 remains largely unknown. In addition, the tumor microenvironment is important in MLS development. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in MLS development. Therefore, we have developed an in vivo-like experimental model system utilizing cell-free scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that can be repopulated with tumor cells. To study the effect of FUS-DDIT3 expression in combination with the MLS microenvironment, we analyzed MLS cell lines as well as fibrosarcoma cells with and without ectopic FUS-DDIT3 expression cultured in scaffolds using cells cultured in monolayers as reference.

        "Summary": "Myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) is the second most common type of liposarcoma and is characterized by the fusion oncogene FUS‐DDIT3 or the less common EWSR1‐DDIT3. While the presence of FUS-DDIT3 as a driver oncoprotein in most MLS cases has been confirmed, the exact molecular action behind the capacity of FUS-DDIT3 for transformation is still unclear and therefore creates a challenge in finding new treatments against this type of cancer. The importance of the microenvironment for tumor progression have long been accepted and might also influence the effect of the fusion oncoprotein. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in myxoid liposarcoma development. Therefore, we have developed a new model system utilizing scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that are decellularized and then repopulated with sarcoma cell lines. This cell culture system mimics in vivo-like tumor cell growth conditions and induce transcriptional changes within the cells. In order to investigate the effect of the microenvironment as well as the fusion oncogene, we analyzed myxoid liposarcoma cell lines as well as fibrosarcoma cells with and without ectopic FUS-DDIT3 expression cultured in scaffolds and adherent two-dimensional growth conditions. We identified several gene networks and processes that are uniquely associated with FUS-DDIT3 expression and with the microenvironment, respectively. The development of patient-derived scaffolds opens up new possibilities to understand tumor development.",

        "Summary": "Purpose: DDL and LMS are two common subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma, a rare group of diseases for which new treatments are needed. Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort. The combination was well tolerated with expected side effects.",

        "Summary": "Patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs) have few therapeutic options. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported. To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production. The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS. Additional studies in diverse sarcoma subtypes will be essential to confirm and expand upon these findings.",

        "Experiment type": "Expression profiling by array",
        "Summary": "Patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs) have few therapeutic options. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported.  To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays.  High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.  The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS. Additional studies in diverse sarcoma subtypes will be essential to confirm and expand upon these findings.",
        "Overall design": "To decipher the mechanism of action of PRMT5 inhibition in STS cell lines, four sarcoma cell lines (the IB111, IB114, IB115, and IB128 cells) were untreated or treated with GSK595 at IC80 every 3 days for 10 days and RNA were analyzed by Nanostring assay using an nCounter Metabolic Pathways Panel in the nCounter Max Analyzer.",

        "Summary": "The WWTR1(TAZ)-CAMTA1 and YAP1-TFE3 gene fusions are disease defining gene alterations for epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, a vascular cancer. The resultant fusion proteins fuse the C terminus of CAMTA1 and TFE3 in frame to the N terminus of TAZ and YAP, respectively. An unbiased BioID-mass spectrometry/RNAi screen identified YEATS2 and ZZZ3 as components of the Ada2a-containing histone acetyltransferase complex and key interactors of both TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3.An integrative NGS approach including RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, and ATAC-Seq showed TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 transcriptional programs overlap with TAZ and YAP but also drive expression of a novel transcriptome.The altered transcriptional program of the fusion proteins owing to altered DNA binding as well as shifts in the chromatin landscape.",
