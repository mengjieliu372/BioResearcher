These genes were enriched for immune tolerance processes (p<0.005) and three targetable immune checkpoint components were upregulated in resistant cases: IDO1, LAG3, and PD1.

Limited availability of RNA generated by some experimental workflows poses an additional challenge and typically adds to the cost of RNA library preparation. In a search for low cost, automation-compatible RNA library preparation kits that also maintain strand specificity and are amenable to low input RNA quantities, we systematically tested two recent commercial technologies – Swift and Swift Rapid – using the Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA, the de facto standard workflow for bulk transcriptomics, as our reference. We used the Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR) (composed of equal quantities of total RNA from 10 human cancer cell lines) to benchmark differential gene expression in these kits, at input quantities ranging between 10 ng to 500 ng. Read quality and alignment metrics revealed high mapping efficiency and uniform read coverage through genes for all samples across all three kits. Normalized read counts between all treatment groups were in high agreement, with pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients >0.97. Compared to the Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA kit, both Swift RNA library kits are cost effective and offer shorter workflow times enabled by their patented Adaptase technology. Furthermore, the Swift RNA kit allows for a relatively broader (and lower) input range, producing consistent results across diverse samples. The Swift Rapid RNA method is the fastest and most cost effective NGS workflow that is best suited for higher RNA yields, with the exact same RNA input range as the Illumina TruSeq kit. We also found the Swift RNA kit to produce the fewest number of differentially expressed genes and pathways attributable to input mRNA concentration.', 'Overall design': 'Comparison of mRNA samples prepared with 3 different library preparation methods (Illumina TruSeq, Swift, Swift Rapid) at multiple input mRNA concentrations', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM5101036': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM5101036', 'name': '100_ng_A10_IL', 'Status': 'Public on Feb 23, 2021', 'Title': '100_ng_A10_IL', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell type: Adenocarcinoma (mammary gland), Melanoma, Hepatoblastoma (liver), Liposarcoma, Adenocarcinoma (cervix), Histiocytic lymphoma (macrophage; histocyte), Embryonal carcinoma (testis), Lymphoblastic leukemia(T lymphoblast), Glioblastoma (brain), Plasmacytoma/myeloma (B lymphocyte)commercial source: ThermoFisher (QS0639)method: Illumina library prep', 'Extracted molecule': 'cDNA', 'Extraction protocol': '1.

Molecularly, the IFS and one LFT harbored EGFR-KDD, while an exon 20 mutation was identified in all FHI, one LFT and in the DFSP and predominantly myxoid spindle cell lesion. By DNAmp, all but two cases formed a well-defined cluster, demonstrating that these lesions are also epigenetically related. In conclusion, EGFR kinase domain aberrations found in FHI, IFS, LFN, DFSP and a spindle cell lesion with a predominant myxoid stroma of children and adolescents show that these neoplasms with a broad morphological spectrum belong to the group of protein kinase-related lesions with a distinct epigenetic signature. Molecular analyses, including DNAmp, help to identify and characterize this emerging category and become mandatory when targeted treatment is considered.', 'Overall design': 'Generated methylation data were compared to sarcoma classifier v12.2-v12.3 (Koelsche et al, 2021), that also allowed for determining copy number alterations.

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

Adenosine to Inosine (A-to-I) editingin thetRNA anticodon stem loop is an important modification that influences anticodon-codon recognition.However,the implications of tRNA editing in cancer and its potential for diagnostic and therapeutic applicationsare not yet well understood.We showed that the ADAT2/3 enzyme complex, responsible for this modification in humans, is amplified and overexpressed in several tumor types,with a higher amplification rate in sarcoma tumors, particularly liposarcomas. We determine that the ADAT complex works as an oncogene in these tumors and that its inhibition reduces tumor growth, offering a new approach to cancer treatment. In addition, we provided insight into the mechanisms of cancer development and progression, demonstrating that tRNA editing is required for higher mRNA translation of oncogenic proteins enriched with specific ADAT-sensitive codons. Thus, ADAT-mediated tRNA modification drives oncogenic transformation by remodeling the set of mRNAs being actively translated to increase expression of proteins that promote proliferation.

While the presence of FUS-DDIT3 as a driver oncoprotein in most MLS cases has been confirmed, the exact molecular action behind the capacity of FUS-DDIT3 for transformation is still unclear and therefore creates a challenge in finding new treatments against this type of cancer. The importance of the microenvironment for tumor progression have long been accepted and might also influence the effect of the fusion oncoprotein. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in myxoid liposarcoma development. Therefore, we have developed a new model system utilizing scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that are decellularized and then repopulated with sarcoma cell lines.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%).

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported. To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production. The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported.  To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays.  High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.  The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS.
