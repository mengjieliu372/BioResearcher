        "input": "$Part 1 of Experimental protocol to be processed$: Part 1: Sample Collection and Characterization\n\nSelect tumor and normal tissue samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) projects. For tumor samples, filter for soft tissue sarcoma cases, particularly liposarcoma, ensuring that the inclusion criteria are met: (1) availability of RNA sequencing data; (2) confirmed diagnosis of liposarcoma through histopathological examination; (3) sufficient sample size for downstream analyses (minimum 10 samples). Aim to collect at least 20 normal tissue samples from GTEx covering a similar anatomical site as the tumors. Utilize TCGA dataset ID: TCGA-LUS, and GTEx dataset ID: GTEx_Analysis_v8.\n\nCharacterize the selected samples through histological analysis. Use H&E staining for all tumor samples to confirm the diagnosis of liposarcoma types (dedifferentiated, myxoid, pleomorphic, etc.). Assess tissue architecture, cellularity, and necrosis. For immunohistochemistry, perform staining for specific markers: CD68 for macrophages (anti-CD68, 1:100, clone KP1), CD3 for T-cells (anti-CD3, 1:200, clone F7.2.38), and PD-L1 for immune checkpoint characterization (anti-PD-L1, 1:50, clone 22C3). Analyzed pathologist should evaluate the staining intensity and distribution. Ensure that all antibodies are sourced from reputable suppliers and include catalog numbers to facilitate procurement.\n\nConduct additional analyses on the characterized samples. Perform histological grading based on the French Federation of Cancer Centers (FFCC) grading system. Classify tumors into low, intermediate, or high grade based on mitotic activity, necrosis, and differentiation. For immune profiling, assess the density of immune cells (macrophages, T-cells) using image analysis software (e.g., ImageJ) to quantify positive staining areas. Document findings in a comprehensive report detailing tumor types, grades, and immune cell infiltration patterns. Include troubleshooting tips for potential issues encountered during sample collection and analysis, along with suggestions for alternative methods or markers if initial findings do not meet expectations.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 1 of experimental protocol.

For TCGA, access the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://gdc.cancer.gov/) and utilize the GDC Data Transfer Tool to download RNA sequencing data for all relevant liposarcoma cases (project ID: TCGA-LI-001). For GTEx, navigate to the GTEx Portal (https://gtexportal.org/) to download the RNA sequencing data for normal tissue samples that correspond to the liposarcoma samples (GTEx ID: GTEX-1234). Ensure that the downloaded files correspond to a total of 80 liposarcoma cases from TCGA and relevant normal tissue samples from GTEx. Verify the integrity of downloaded files using checksums provided on the download page.\n\nPre-processing raw gene counts from the downloaded RNA sequencing data. First, perform quality control on the FASTQ files using FastQC (version 0.11.9) to assess the quality of the sequencing data. Generate summary reports to identify any quality issues such as low-quality reads or adapter contamination. Next, use Trimmomatic (version 0.39) to trim low-quality bases and remove adapter sequences with the following parameters: 'ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10' for adapter removal and 'SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20' for quality trimming. After trimming, align the cleaned reads to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using STAR (version 2.7.9a) with parameters set for two-pass alignment. After alignment, use featureCounts (part of the Subread package, version 2.0.1) to count the number of reads mapping to each gene, generating a raw count matrix that will be the basis for subsequent normalization and analysis.\n\nNormalizing the raw gene counts using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0) or gcRMA. For DESeq2, create a DESeqDataSet object using the raw count matrix and specify the experimental design. Use the 'estimateSizeFactors' function to determine size factors for normalization, followed by the 'varianceStabilizingTransformation' function to stabilize variance across the counts. If using gcRMA instead, apply the gcRMA algorithm to the raw count matrix to obtain normalized expression values. After normalization, perform batch effect correction using the ComBat function from the sva package (version 3.38.0), ensuring that any known batch variables are included as covariates. Document all parameter settings used during normalization to ensure reproducibility.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 2 of experimental protocol.

For TCGA, access the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://gdc.cancer.gov/) and utilize the GDC Data Transfer Tool to download RNA sequencing data for all relevant liposarcoma cases (project ID: TCGA-LI-001). For GTEx, navigate to the GTEx Portal (https://gtexportal.org/) to download the RNA sequencing data for normal tissue samples that correspond to the liposarcoma samples (GTEx ID: GTEX-1234). Ensure that the downloaded files correspond to a total of 80 liposarcoma cases from TCGA and relevant normal tissue samples from GTEx. Verify the integrity of downloaded files using checksums provided on the download page.\n\nPre-processing raw gene counts from the downloaded RNA sequencing data. First, perform quality control on the FASTQ files using FastQC (version 0.11.9) to assess the quality of the sequencing data. Generate summary reports to identify any quality issues such as low-quality reads or adapter contamination. Next, use Trimmomatic (version 0.39) to trim low-quality bases and remove adapter sequences with the following parameters: 'ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10' for adapter removal and 'SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20' for quality trimming. After trimming, align the cleaned reads to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using STAR (version 2.7.9a) with parameters set for two-pass alignment. After alignment, use featureCounts (part of the Subread package, version 2.0.1) to count the number of reads mapping to each gene, generating a raw count matrix that will be the basis for subsequent normalization and analysis.\n\nNormalizing the raw gene counts using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0) or gcRMA. For DESeq2, create a DESeqDataSet object using the raw count matrix and specify the experimental design. Use the 'estimateSizeFactors' function to determine size factors for normalization, followed by the 'varianceStabilizingTransformation' function to stabilize variance across the counts. If using gcRMA instead, apply the gcRMA algorithm to the raw count matrix to obtain normalized expression values. After normalization, perform batch effect correction using the ComBat function from the sva package (version 3.38.0), ensuring that any known batch variables are included as covariates. Document all parameter settings used during normalization to ensure reproducibility.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 2 of experimental protocol.

The dataset ID for TCGA is 'TCGA-LPS' and for GTEx is 'GTEx-LPS'. Create a design matrix that incorporates the experimental conditions (treatment vs. control) into the analysis. Apply the linear model to the dataset using the 'lmFit()' function in Limma, and conduct empirical Bayes moderation using the 'eBayes()' function to stabilize variance estimates. Set statistical thresholds for significance at an adjusted P-value < 0.001 and |log2(fold change)| > 1 to identify differentially expressed genes.\n\nExtract the identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the analysis output. Create a list of DEGs along with their corresponding log2 fold changes and adjusted P-values. Generate visualizations such as volcano plots using the 'ggplot2' package and heatmaps using the 'pheatmap' package to present the DEG results clearly. Ensure that the plots highlight significant DEGs based on the defined thresholds and include annotations to indicate the biological relevance of selected genes.\n\nValidate the identified DEGs using qPCR (quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) on frozen samples and sarcoma cell lines.

Perform qPCR on RNA extracted from the frozen samples (IDs: 'FrozenSample1', 'FrozenSample2', etc.) and cell lines (IDs: 'CellLine1', 'CellLine2', etc.) to confirm the expression patterns obtained from RNA sequencing.

Each identified dry experimental step corresponds to specific tasks outlined in the protocol, such as data collection, standardization, statistical analysis, and the use of R software. However, there are minor discrepancies in the specificity of the inputs and outputs, particularly regarding the types of data and formats mentioned.\n\n**Detail: 4/5**\nThe extraction captures the essential steps of the experimental protocol, providing a clear task description, input, and output for each dry experiment. However, some areas could benefit from additional detail, such as specifying the types of statistical tests used in the analysis and clarifying the format of the datasets more explicitly.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n1. **Input and Output Specificity:**\n   - Enhance the descriptions of inputs and outputs by specifying the exact formats (e.g., \"CSV file\" vs. \"Excel file\") and including examples of the data structure (e.g., column names, data types).\n   - For statistical analysis, include specific details about the statistical tests being performed (e.g., \"log-rank test for survival analysis\") and the expected format of the results (e.g., \"summary statistics table\").\n\n2. **Task Descriptions:**\n   - Provide more context in the task descriptions to clarify the purpose of each step. For instance, explain why standardization of clinical outcome metrics is necessary and how it impacts the analysis.\n\n3. **Consistency in Terminology:**\n   - Ensure consistent use of terminology throughout the extraction. For example, if \"gene expression data\" is used in one task, it should be referred to in the same way in subsequent tasks.\n\n4. **Clarification of Statistical Software Usage:**\n   - Specify the version of R and the packages used, as well as any relevant settings or parameters that might affect the analysis.\n\n5. **Output Formats:**\n   - Clarify the expected output formats for visualizations and statistical summaries, including whether they will be saved as files or displayed in R.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the extraction can be improved in terms of both accuracy and detail, providing a clearer and more comprehensive overview of the dry experimental steps.\n\nFinal integral score: [4]"
