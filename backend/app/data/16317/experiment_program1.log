FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported. To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production. The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported.  To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays.  High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.  The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS.

However, it could benefit from more specific parameters regarding the selection process, such as the exact criteria for evaluating immune cell infiltration and tumor grade. Additionally, specifying the exact assays and methods for RNA extraction and immunohistochemistry would enhance reproducibility.\n\n2. **Factual Reliability (Score: 5)**  \n   The information presented appears to be accurate and reliable, with references to established practices in sample selection and characterization. The use of clinical parameters and histological examination aligns with standard protocols in cancer research.\n\n3. **Relevance (Score: 5)**  \n   The protocol is highly relevant to the research objectives, focusing on the immune microenvironment in liposarcoma. The steps outlined directly support the goal of characterizing samples for subsequent transcriptomic analyses.\n\n4. **Referability and Modifications (Score: 4)**  \n   The protocol includes references to previous reports, which is beneficial for traceability. However, it could improve by explicitly stating how the current protocol builds upon or modifies previous recommendations. Including a section that discusses potential modifications based on preliminary findings or specific challenges encountered during sample acquisition would enhance its adaptability.\n\n5. **Logical Structure (Score: 4)**  \n   The protocol is logically structured, with clear steps that follow a coherent progression from sample selection to characterization. However, the transition between steps could be improved by adding brief explanations of how each step leads into the next, particularly in the context of the overall research objectives.\n\n### Areas for Improvement and Modification Suggestions\n\n- **Detail Level:**  \n  - Specify the exact metrics or scoring systems used for evaluating tumor grade and immune cell infiltration. For example, include thresholds for what constitutes high vs. low immune infiltration.\n  - Provide detailed protocols for RNA extraction and immunohistochemistry, including specific reagents, concentrations, and incubation times.\n\n- **Referability and Modifications:**  \n  - Add a section that discusses how this protocol can be adapted based on initial findings or challenges faced during sample acquisition. This could include alternative methods for sample selection or analysis if certain criteria are not met.\n\n- **Logical Structure:**  \n  - Improve transitions between steps by adding brief explanations of how each step contributes to the overall research goals. For instance, explain how the selection of specific samples will impact the subsequent RNA sequencing analysis.\n\n- **General Clarity:**  \n  - Consider using bullet points or numbered lists for the criteria in step 2 to enhance readability and clarity.\n\nFinal Integral Score: [4.4]"

However, while it specifies the number of samples and the criteria for selection, it could benefit from more explicit details regarding the specific immunohistochemical methods, including the exact antibodies and their concentrations, as well as the protocols for RNA extraction from frozen and paraffin-embedded tissues.\n\n2. **Factual Reliability (Score: 5)**  \n   The information presented appears to be accurate and reliable, with references to established practices in sample selection and characterization. The criteria for tumor grade and immune cell infiltration are consistent with standard protocols in cancer research.\n\n3. **Relevance (Score: 5)**  \n   The protocol is highly relevant to the research objectives, focusing on the immune microenvironment in liposarcoma. The steps outlined directly support the goal of characterizing samples for subsequent transcriptomic analyses.\n\n4. **Referability and Modifications (Score: 4)**  \n   The protocol includes references to previous reports, which is beneficial for traceability. However, it could improve by explicitly stating how the current protocol builds upon or modifies previous recommendations. Including a section that discusses potential modifications based on preliminary findings or specific challenges encountered during sample acquisition would enhance its adaptability.\n\n5. **Logical Structure (Score: 4)**  \n   The protocol is logically structured, with clear steps that follow a coherent progression from sample selection to characterization. However, the transition between steps could be improved by adding brief explanations of how each step leads into the next, particularly in the context of the overall research objectives.\n\n### Areas for Improvement and Modification Suggestions\n\n- **Detail Level:**  \n  - Specify the exact antibodies used for immunohistochemistry, including their concentrations and incubation times. For example, include details such as \"CD3 antibody (1:100 dilution, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature)\".\n  - Provide detailed protocols for RNA extraction, including specific reagents, volumes, and incubation times for both frozen and paraffin-embedded tissues.\n\n- **Referability and Modifications:**  \n  - Add a section that discusses how this protocol can be adapted based on initial findings or challenges faced during sample acquisition.

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

FUS-DDIT3 is causative in tumor development, but the molecular function of FUS-DDIT3 remains largely unknown. In addition, the tumor microenvironment is important in MLS development. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in MLS development. Therefore, we have developed an in vivo-like experimental model system utilizing cell-free scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that can be repopulated with tumor cells.

While the presence of FUS-DDIT3 as a driver oncoprotein in most MLS cases has been confirmed, the exact molecular action behind the capacity of FUS-DDIT3 for transformation is still unclear and therefore creates a challenge in finding new treatments against this type of cancer. The importance of the microenvironment for tumor progression have long been accepted and might also influence the effect of the fusion oncoprotein. However, due to a lack of relevant experimental model systems, it has been challenging to examine the microenvironmental impact in myxoid liposarcoma development. Therefore, we have developed a new model system utilizing scaffolds derived from myxoid liposarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors that are decellularized and then repopulated with sarcoma cell lines. This cell culture system mimics in vivo-like tumor cell growth conditions and induce transcriptional changes within the cells.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort.

FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest.

Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported. To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production. The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS. Additional studies in diverse sarcoma subtypes will be essential to confirm and expand upon these findings.', 'Overall design': 'To decipher the mechanism of action of PRMT5 inhibition in STS cell lines, we explored the transcriptomic changes in IB111 cells after 10 days of treatment by RNA sequencing.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported.  To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays.  High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.  The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS. Additional studies in diverse sarcoma subtypes will be essential to confirm and expand upon these findings.', 'Overall design': 'To decipher the mechanism of action of PRMT5 inhibition in STS cell lines, four sarcoma cell lines (the IB111, IB114, IB115, and IB128 cells) were untreated or treated with GSK595 at IC80 every 3 days for 10 days and RNA were analyzed by Nanostring assay using an nCounter Metabolic Pathways Panel in the nCounter Max Analyzer.', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL31904, NanoString  nCounter Human  Metabolic Pathways Panel [Gene Symbol version]', 'Samples': {'GSM7795419': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM7795419', 'name': 'IB111 cell line, Control, rep1', 'Supplementary file': [{'file_name': 'GSM7795419_20211109_31020962105_run2_IB111_n1_ctl_07.RCC.gz', 'file_size': '8.7 Kb', 'file_type': 'RCC', 'download_link': '/geo/download/?acc=GSM7795419&format=file&file=GSM7795419%5F20211109%5F31020962105%5Frun2%5FIB111%5Fn1%5Fctl%5F07%2ERCC%2Egz'}], 'Status': 'Public on Sep 25, 2023', 'Title': 'IB111 cell line, Control, rep1', 'Sample type': 'RNA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell type: dedifferentiated liposarcoma', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were untreated or treated with GSK595 at their respective IC80 every 3 days for 10 days', 'Growth protocol': 'Cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 GlutaMAX Supplement in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2', 'Extracted molecule': 'total RNA', 'Extraction protocol': 'RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen).

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%).

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported. To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production. The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an anticancer target, has been extensively investigated in recent years in epithelial tumors. To date, no data related to the biological role of PRMT5 inhibition and its potential effect as a treatment in STS have been reported.  To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays.  High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.  The present study demonstrated that PRMT5 regulates STS cell metabolism and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for STS.

However, the reliability could be improved by citing specific studies or reviews that support the chosen methods for clustering and annotation of cell types. This would provide a stronger foundation for the methods used.\n\n3. **Relevance (Score: 5)**  \n   The protocol is highly relevant to the research objectives, as it focuses on integrating single-cell sequencing data to characterize the immune microenvironment in liposarcoma. This directly aligns with the overall goal of understanding immune interactions in the context of the disease.\n\n4. **Referability and Modifications (Score: 3)**  \n   While the protocol references specific datasets, it lacks citations for the methodologies used in the analysis. Including references to established protocols or guidelines for single-cell RNA sequencing analysis would enhance its referability. Additionally, suggestions for potential modifications based on preliminary findings or specific characteristics of the datasets could be included.\n\n5. **Logical Structure (Score: 4)**  \n   The protocol is logically structured, with a clear progression from data acquisition to analysis and correlation. However, the flow could be improved by explicitly stating the objectives of each step and how they contribute to the overall research goals.

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting pediatric, adolescent, and young and middle-aged adults, with prognosis depending on the fusion and whether the disease is localized, metastatic, or relapsed. New therapies are needed for these patients. These translocations fuse the 5’ portion of the FET family gene with a 3’ partner gene encoding a transcription factor. The resulting fusion proteins have the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of the FET protein paired with a DNA binding domain and these chimeras function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising new therapeutic strategies target the critical regulators and co-regulators of these proteins. One such protein is the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 physically interacts with and is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 gene regulation and prior studies showed that treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocked the transcriptional activity of the fusion. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), was identified as a promising lead for clinical development and is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against EWSR1::FLI1 or any other FET fusion protein has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the in vitro potency of seclidemstat against multiple cell lines derived from different FET-rearranged sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma. We also defined the transcriptomic effect of seclidemstat treatment in these diseases and evaluated the activity of seclidemstat against FET fusion transcriptional regulation in multiple cell lines. Seclidemstat showed potent activity in cell viability assays in all four FET-rearranged sarcomas and disrupted the transcriptional function of all the tested fusion proteins. Though epigenetic and targeted inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as a single agents in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged sarcomas', 'Overall design': 'To evaluate the pharmacologic effects of seclidemstat treatment on the transcriptomes of FET-rearranged sarcoma cell lines, we treated 9 cell lines expressing a variety of FET fusion oncogenes with either DMSO or the IC90 dose of seclidemstat for 48 hours, collected RNA, and performed RNA-seq', 'Platforms': 'Platforms (1), GPL24676, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)', 'Samples': {'GSM8270121': {'link': '/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8270121', 'name': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Status': 'Public on Jun 12, 2024', 'Title': '1765-92,DMSO,48h,Rep1', 'Sample type': 'SRA', 'Organism': 'Homo sapiens', 'Characteristics': 'cell line: 1765-92cell type: myxoid liposarcomagenotype: wildtypetreatment: DMSOtime: 48hreplicate: Rep1', 'Treatment protocol': 'Cells were seeded at 30% confluency and left to adhere overnight.

Chemotherapy remains the standard option for advanced disease. Targeting CDK4/6 in DDL and mTOR in LMS is of biologic interest. When combined, the CDK4 inhibitor ribociclib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, have shown synergistic growth inhibition in multiple tumor models, suggesting that this combination could be beneficial in patients.Methods: This was a single arm, open label, multi-center phase II study of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus. Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts: DDL or LMS with intact Rb. The primary endpoint was progression free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free (PFS) and overall survival, safety and biomarker analyses. Results: In the DDL cohort, 33.3% (95% CI 15.6%-55.3%) of patients were progression free at 16 weeks. Median PFS in this cohort was 15.4 weeks (95% CI, 8-36 weeks) with 2 partial responses. In the LMS cohort the PFR at 16 weeks was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6%-51.1%). Median PFS in this cohort was 15.7 weeks (95% CI 7.7-NA). Most common toxicities included fatigue (66.7%), anorexia (43.8%) and hyperglycemia (43.8%). Concordance between Rb testing methodologies was poor.Conclusions: The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrates activity in DDL with prolonged stable disease (≥16 weeks) meeting the primary endpoint. Notably partial responses were observed. The primary endpoint was not reached in the LMS cohort.

To investigate the therapeutic potential of PRMT5 targeting in STS, we first evaluated the prognostic value of PRMT5 expression in 2 different cohorts of patients with STS. We then used the potent and selective GSK3326595 (GSK595) compound to investigate the antitumor effect of the pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in vitro via MTT, apoptosis, cell cycle, clonogenicity and proliferation assays. In vivo studies were performed with two animal models to evaluate the effects of GSK595 on tumor growth. The mechanisms of action were investigated by RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, Western blotting and glucose uptake/lactate production assays. High PRMT5 gene expression levels were significantly associated with worsened metastasis-free survival of STS patients. GSK595 decreased the global symmetric dimethylarginine level, the proliferation rate and clonogenicity of STS cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibition regulated aerobic glycolysis through downregulation of key enzymes of glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and lactate production.
