Here, we employed EcoTyper, \na machine-learning framework, to identify the fundamental cell states \nand cellular ecosystems that make up sarcomas on a large scale using bulk \ntranscriptomes with clinical annotations. We identified and validated  \n23 sarcoma-specific, transcriptionally defined cell states, many of which \nwere highly prognostic of patient outcomes across independent datasets. \nWe discovered three conserved cellular communities or ecotypes associated \nwith underlying genomic alterations and distinct clinical outcomes.  \nWe show that one ecotype defined by tumor-associated macrophages and \nepithelial-like malignant cells predicts response to immune-checkpoint \ninhibition but not chemotherapy and validate our findings in an \nindependent cohort. Our results may enable identification of patients with \nsoft tissue sarcomas who could benefit from immunotherapy and help \ndevelop new therapeutic strategies.\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are rare and diverse neoplasms that arise \nfrom connective tissues throughout the body in patients of all ages1. \nAlthough surgery can cure many patients with localized disease, nearly \nhalf of patients with large, high-grade STSs develop metastatic dis-\nease2. Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7. In addition, a gene expression \nsignature related to genomic complexity (CINSARC) has been validated \nReceived: 24 June 2023\nAccepted: 8 February 2024\nPublished online: xx xx xxxx\n Check for updates\n1Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 2Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. \n3Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 4Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. \n5Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 6Marie-Josee and Henry R.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18. One SIC characterized by high immune infiltration \nand the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) was associ-\nated with better outcomes in patients with localized sarcomas and \nLocalized STSs\nSurvival\nShorter\nLonger\nTime\nSurvival (%)\nDeconvolution of\ncell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nIdentification of\ntranscriptional\ncell states\nDiscovery of tumor\ncellular ecosystems\n(ecotypes)\nAdvanced STSs\nChemotherapy\ncohort\nImmunotherapy\ntraining cohort\nImmunotherapy\nvalidation cohort\nn = 37\nn = 38\nn = 29\nTraining cohort\n(RNA-seq)\nValidation cohort\n(Microarray)\nn = 299 bulk sarcomas\nn = 310 bulk sarcomas\nBulk RNA-seq profiles of\nSTSs\nCell state identification\nfrom bulk gene expression\nCell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nValidation of cell states\nusing scRNA-seq\nAssociation between cell\nstates and clinical outcomes\nAssociation between ecotypes\nand clinical outcomes\nValidation of ecotypes using\nspatial transcriptomics\nCellular communities based on\nco-occurring cell states\n3 histologies\n19 tumors\n31,760 cells\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic\ncells\nEndothelial\ncells\nEpithelial-like\ncells\nFibroblast-like\ncells\nMast cells\nMonocytes and\nmacrophages\nPMNs\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nSS\nMPNST\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nOther\na\nFig. 1 | A machine-learning framework for large-scale identification and \nvalidation of sarcoma cell states and ecosystems. a, Schematic showing the \nimplementation of EcoTyper in patients with STS. Cell states and ecotypes were \ninitially discovered in a training cohort of patients with localized STS profiled \nwith RNA-seq followed by validation in a separate cohort of patients with \nlocalized STS with gene expression analyzed by microarray. Cell-type-specific \ngene expression was purified from bulk transcriptomic data before identification \nof transcriptional states for each cell type. Cell states were validated via scRNA-\nseq and the associations between cell-state abundances and patient outcomes \nwere analyzed. SEs were discovered by determining the co-occurrence patterns \nbetween cell states and the spatial distribution of the ecotypes and cell states \nwas validated using spatial transcriptomics. Finally, the association between SEs \nand patient outcomes was analyzed.

This framework has been optimized using \nsimulated tumors to choose the number of cell states that maximizes \nsensitivity and positive predictive value of the cell states discovered \nwhile maintaining the stability of clustering results20. Using this \napproach, we identified two to four cell states per cell type, repre-\nsenting 23 distinct cell states (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 4). We \nthen performed reference-guided recovery of the cell states identified \nin non-LMS STSs from TCGA to estimate the abundance of each cell \nstate in the remaining sarcomas within our training and independent \nvalidation cohorts.\nTo validate the cell states identified from bulk gene expression, \nwe performed scRNA-seq on four LMSs and three UPSs from a total \nof six patients (Supplementary Table 5) and analyzed previously pub-\nlished scRNA-seq from 12 synovial sarcomas (SSs) from ten patients15 \n(Extended Data Fig. 1b). We implemented a hybrid approach, leveraging \ninferred copy-number variation and similarity of single-cell transcrip-\ntomes to bulk sarcoma gene expression to identify malignant and \nnormal cells within our scRNA-seq datasets (Extended Data Fig. 2a–d \nand Supplementary Table 6).

Most of the cell states that were not significantly \nrecovered were not represented or had low abundance in our scRNA-seq \ndata. To explore the functions of the identified sarcoma cell states, we \ndefined marker genes for the most abundant cell states present within \nthe scRNA-seq datasets (Supplementary Table 8). Cell-state marker \ngene expression was reproducible across STS histologies profiled by \nscRNA-seq (Fig. 2b).

State 1 (S01) and S02 monocytes/\nmacrophages expressed markers previously associated with M2-like \nmacrophage polarization with distinct expression signatures between \nstates (CLEC5A and SPP1 in S01 monocytes/macrophages and ROMO1 \nand STAB1 in S02 monocytes/macrophages)23–26. In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c). Higher B cell abundance has previously been \nreported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with \nsarcomas18, and a higher abundance of CD69+ activated memory B cells \n(S01) was significantly associated with better outcomes in our training \ncohort and trended toward better outcomes in the validation cohort. \n \na\nCell type\nState abundance\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic cells\nECs\nEpithelial-like cells\nFibroblast-like cells\nMast cells\nMono/mac\nPMNs\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nCo-occurence of cell states\nin sarcoma ecotypes \nEpi\nMac\nDC\nPMN\nEpi\nFib\nEndo\nB\nB\nCD8\nCD8\nMac\nMast\nPMN\nb\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nEpi\nEndo\nB\nCD8\nDC\nMast\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nc\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nC2\nC1\nSarcoma\necotype\nSarcoma\nimmune class\nSarcoma\necotype\nCINSARC\nsignature\nData from TCGA\nData from Chibon et al.\nEcotype\nCell type\nState\nHistology\nLPS\nMPNST\nUPS\nSS\nLMS\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nDistribution of cell-state abundances\nacross sarcoma ecotypes \nComparison of sarcoma ecotypes with\npublished gene expression signatures \nFig. 4 | Discovery of sarcoma multicellular communities. a, Heat map of cell-\nstate abundances across STSs of different histologies from the discovery cohort \nseparated into three SEs.

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d). Patients assigned \nto SE1 seemed to have an intermediate prognosis. In patients from the \ntraining cohort with more detailed clinical information available, we \nobserved similar results when including the prognostic factors tumor \na\nBiologic features of sarcoma ecotypes \nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0\n5,000\n10,000\n15,000\n20,000\n25,000\nTotal genes altered\nCNAs\n2.9 × 10–7\n4.6 × 10–5\nUPS\nLPS\nLMS\nMPNST\nSS\nDendritic cells\nNeutrophils\nB cells\nPlasma cells\nMast cells\nCD4+ T cells\nMono/Macro\nNK cells\nCD8+ T cells\nEpithelial-like cells\nECs\nFibroblast-like cells\nMale\nFemale\nAge ≥ 60\nE2F targets\nG2M checkpoint\nHedgehog signaling\nInterferon-α response\nInterferon-γ response\nKRAS signaling up\nMTORC1 signaling\nMYC targets V1\nMYC targets V2\nHistology percentage\n0\n50\n100\nRelative cell-type abundance\n−1.5\n−1\n−0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nFeature enrichment (Q < 0.05)\nEnriched\nDepleted\nSE\n1\n2\n3\nh\nf\ne\nH&E\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0\n10\n20\n30\nMoran’s I (z-score)\nSpatial dispersion of\nSEs\nSRC107\nSRC106\nSRC95\nSRC93\ng\nNo\nYes\n–0.8\n–0.6\n–0.4\n–0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nSame ecotype\nSpearman correlation\nCell-state\nspatial correlation\nP = 6.5 × 10–10\nSpatial distribution of SEs by\nspatial transcriptomics\nLigand-receptor networks in\nSEs\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nB\nB\nCD8\nEndo\nEpi\nFib\nMast\nMac\nPMN\nEndo\nEpi\nB\nMac\nEpi\nPMN\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nNormalized activity\nCOSMIC signature 2\n0.008\n0.07\n0\n0.33 0.67\n1\nCell type/ecotype\nabundance\n0\n0.33 0.67\n1\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nFibroblast-like\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nComparison of genomic alterations across SEs\n0\n20\n40\n0\n10k\n20k\nTotal\nCNAs\nTotal\nSNVs/\nIndels\n0\n10 20 30\n0\n50\n100\nNumber\nof patients\nTP53\nATRX\nRB1\nMTOR (1p36.22)\nFGFR3 (4p16.3)\nMAP2K4 (17p12)\nMYC (8q24.21)\nSRC (20q11.23)\nFH (1q43)\nRB1 (13q14.2)\nAPC (5q22.2)\nCASP8 (2q33.1)\nCDKN2A (9p21.3)\nSNV/indel type\nNonsense\nSplice\nIndel\nMissense\nCNA type\nShallow deletion\nGain\nDeep deletion\nAmplification\n8.5e-06\n2.8e-04\n2.76e-04\n7.3e-04\n4.68e-04\n1.5e-05\n3.5e-03\n1.6e-03\n1.7e-02\n5.1e-03\nAdjusted\nP value\n0.98\n0.40\n0.81\nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nsize, grade, histology, extent of resection and anatomic site in the mul-\ntivariable analysis (Supplementary Table 17)6,7,43. These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c). We observed stable to slightly increased S01 CD8+ T cell \nabundance (Fig. 8f) with a significant decrease in the S01 M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages associated with SE3 after starting \n \na\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n10\n–2\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox DMFS\nhazard ratio\nValidation (microarray)\nValidation (microarray)\nb\nc\nd\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.07\n0.08\nn = 100\nn = 37\nn = 92\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nDMFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.08\n0.04\nn = 90\nn = 44\nn = 77\nFig. 6 | Association of SEs with patient outcomes. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of \nPFS in the training cohort stratified by SE assignment.

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

Previous \nstudies have also associated APOBEC mutagenesis with increased \nimmune infiltration into tumors and improved survival in other can-\ncers52,53. The lower mutational burden and lower APOBEC mutagenesis \nin SE1 may explain the low immune infiltration into these tumors. Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review \nBoards at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Written \ninformed consent was obtained for all samples collected and all data \nincluded in this study.\nTraining cohort\nPre-processed bulk RNA-seq profiles of STSs from TCGA were down-\nloaded60 and scaled to transcripts per million (TPM). BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained.

DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Here, we employed EcoTyper, \na machine-learning framework, to identify the fundamental cell states \nand cellular ecosystems that make up sarcomas on a large scale using bulk \ntranscriptomes with clinical annotations. We identified and validated  \n23 sarcoma-specific, transcriptionally defined cell states, many of which \nwere highly prognostic of patient outcomes across independent datasets. \nWe discovered three conserved cellular communities or ecotypes associated \nwith underlying genomic alterations and distinct clinical outcomes.  \nWe show that one ecotype defined by tumor-associated macrophages and \nepithelial-like malignant cells predicts response to immune-checkpoint \ninhibition but not chemotherapy and validate our findings in an \nindependent cohort. Our results may enable identification of patients with \nsoft tissue sarcomas who could benefit from immunotherapy and help \ndevelop new therapeutic strategies.\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are rare and diverse neoplasms that arise \nfrom connective tissues throughout the body in patients of all ages1. \nAlthough surgery can cure many patients with localized disease, nearly \nhalf of patients with large, high-grade STSs develop metastatic dis-\nease2. Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7. In addition, a gene expression \nsignature related to genomic complexity (CINSARC) has been validated \nReceived: 24 June 2023\nAccepted: 8 February 2024\nPublished online: xx xx xxxx\n Check for updates\n1Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 2Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. \n3Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 4Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. \n5Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 6Marie-Josee and Henry R.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18. One SIC characterized by high immune infiltration \nand the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) was associ-\nated with better outcomes in patients with localized sarcomas and \nLocalized STSs\nSurvival\nShorter\nLonger\nTime\nSurvival (%)\nDeconvolution of\ncell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nIdentification of\ntranscriptional\ncell states\nDiscovery of tumor\ncellular ecosystems\n(ecotypes)\nAdvanced STSs\nChemotherapy\ncohort\nImmunotherapy\ntraining cohort\nImmunotherapy\nvalidation cohort\nn = 37\nn = 38\nn = 29\nTraining cohort\n(RNA-seq)\nValidation cohort\n(Microarray)\nn = 299 bulk sarcomas\nn = 310 bulk sarcomas\nBulk RNA-seq profiles of\nSTSs\nCell state identification\nfrom bulk gene expression\nCell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nValidation of cell states\nusing scRNA-seq\nAssociation between cell\nstates and clinical outcomes\nAssociation between ecotypes\nand clinical outcomes\nValidation of ecotypes using\nspatial transcriptomics\nCellular communities based on\nco-occurring cell states\n3 histologies\n19 tumors\n31,760 cells\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic\ncells\nEndothelial\ncells\nEpithelial-like\ncells\nFibroblast-like\ncells\nMast cells\nMonocytes and\nmacrophages\nPMNs\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nSS\nMPNST\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nOther\na\nFig. 1 | A machine-learning framework for large-scale identification and \nvalidation of sarcoma cell states and ecosystems. a, Schematic showing the \nimplementation of EcoTyper in patients with STS.

Cell-type-specific \ngene expression was purified from bulk transcriptomic data before identification \nof transcriptional states for each cell type. Cell states were validated via scRNA-\nseq and the associations between cell-state abundances and patient outcomes \nwere analyzed. SEs were discovered by determining the co-occurrence patterns \nbetween cell states and the spatial distribution of the ecotypes and cell states \nwas validated using spatial transcriptomics. Finally, the association between SEs \nand patient outcomes was analyzed.

State 1 (S01) and S02 monocytes/\nmacrophages expressed markers previously associated with M2-like \nmacrophage polarization with distinct expression signatures between \nstates (CLEC5A and SPP1 in S01 monocytes/macrophages and ROMO1 \nand STAB1 in S02 monocytes/macrophages)23–26. In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c). Higher B cell abundance has previously been \nreported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with \nsarcomas18, and a higher abundance of CD69+ activated memory B cells \n(S01) was significantly associated with better outcomes in our training \ncohort and trended toward better outcomes in the validation cohort. \n \na\nCell type\nState abundance\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic cells\nECs\nEpithelial-like cells\nFibroblast-like cells\nMast cells\nMono/mac\nPMNs\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nCo-occurence of cell states\nin sarcoma ecotypes \nEpi\nMac\nDC\nPMN\nEpi\nFib\nEndo\nB\nB\nCD8\nCD8\nMac\nMast\nPMN\nb\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nEpi\nEndo\nB\nCD8\nDC\nMast\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nc\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nC2\nC1\nSarcoma\necotype\nSarcoma\nimmune class\nSarcoma\necotype\nCINSARC\nsignature\nData from TCGA\nData from Chibon et al.\nEcotype\nCell type\nState\nHistology\nLPS\nMPNST\nUPS\nSS\nLMS\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nDistribution of cell-state abundances\nacross sarcoma ecotypes \nComparison of sarcoma ecotypes with\npublished gene expression signatures \nFig. 4 | Discovery of sarcoma multicellular communities. a, Heat map of cell-\nstate abundances across STSs of different histologies from the discovery cohort \nseparated into three SEs.

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d).

These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c).

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

Previous \nstudies have also associated APOBEC mutagenesis with increased \nimmune infiltration into tumors and improved survival in other can-\ncers52,53. The lower mutational burden and lower APOBEC mutagenesis \nin SE1 may explain the low immune infiltration into these tumors. Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review \nBoards at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Written \ninformed consent was obtained for all samples collected and all data \nincluded in this study.\nTraining cohort\nPre-processed bulk RNA-seq profiles of STSs from TCGA were down-\nloaded60 and scaled to transcripts per million (TPM). BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55).

High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

They start with the identification of lncRNAs, move through their implications for prognosis, and conclude with their roles in immune response and resistance. However, the transition between some sections could be smoother to enhance the flow of the protocol.\n\n2. **Consistency (Score: 5)**: The headings consistently align with the content of the paper. Each heading accurately reflects the focus of the corresponding section, maintaining a clear connection to the research objectives and findings.\n\n3. **Format Alignment (Score: 4)**: The headings mostly adhere to the format established in the $Paper for reference$'s experimental protocol. They are clear and descriptive, but some could be more concise to match the succinctness of the reference headings.\n\n4. **Exclusion of Non-Experimental Content (Score: 5)**: All headings are relevant to the experimental content, and there are no headings related to non-experimental sections such as \"introduction,\" \"discussion,\" or \"conclusion.\" This is a strong point of the protocol.\n\n**Feedback for Improvement**:\n- **Enhance Logical Flow**: Consider reordering some sections or adding transitional phrases to improve the logical flow between headings. For example, linking the identification of lncRNAs directly to their implications for prognosis could provide a clearer narrative.\n  \n- **Conciseness in Headings**: Some headings could be shortened for brevity. For instance, \"ICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated With a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\" could be simplified to \"Overexpression of ICLs Correlates With Poor Prognosis.\"\n\n- **Clarify Relationships**: In the heading \"ICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative Regulation of the Immune Response,\" it might be beneficial to specify that this refers to the roles of lncRNAs in the context of sarcoma, to maintain focus on the specific subject of the study.\n\nFinal Score: [4]"

Here, we employed EcoTyper, \na machine-learning framework, to identify the fundamental cell states \nand cellular ecosystems that make up sarcomas on a large scale using bulk \ntranscriptomes with clinical annotations. We identified and validated  \n23 sarcoma-specific, transcriptionally defined cell states, many of which \nwere highly prognostic of patient outcomes across independent datasets. \nWe discovered three conserved cellular communities or ecotypes associated \nwith underlying genomic alterations and distinct clinical outcomes.  \nWe show that one ecotype defined by tumor-associated macrophages and \nepithelial-like malignant cells predicts response to immune-checkpoint \ninhibition but not chemotherapy and validate our findings in an \nindependent cohort. Our results may enable identification of patients with \nsoft tissue sarcomas who could benefit from immunotherapy and help \ndevelop new therapeutic strategies.\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are rare and diverse neoplasms that arise \nfrom connective tissues throughout the body in patients of all ages1. \nAlthough surgery can cure many patients with localized disease, nearly \nhalf of patients with large, high-grade STSs develop metastatic dis-\nease2. Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18. One SIC characterized by high immune infiltration \nand the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) was associ-\nated with better outcomes in patients with localized sarcomas and \nLocalized STSs\nSurvival\nShorter\nLonger\nTime\nSurvival (%)\nDeconvolution of\ncell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nIdentification of\ntranscriptional\ncell states\nDiscovery of tumor\ncellular ecosystems\n(ecotypes)\nAdvanced STSs\nChemotherapy\ncohort\nImmunotherapy\ntraining cohort\nImmunotherapy\nvalidation cohort\nn = 37\nn = 38\nn = 29\nTraining cohort\n(RNA-seq)\nValidation cohort\n(Microarray)\nn = 299 bulk sarcomas\nn = 310 bulk sarcomas\nBulk RNA-seq profiles of\nSTSs\nCell state identification\nfrom bulk gene expression\nCell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nValidation of cell states\nusing scRNA-seq\nAssociation between cell\nstates and clinical outcomes\nAssociation between ecotypes\nand clinical outcomes\nValidation of ecotypes using\nspatial transcriptomics\nCellular communities based on\nco-occurring cell states\n3 histologies\n19 tumors\n31,760 cells\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic\ncells\nEndothelial\ncells\nEpithelial-like\ncells\nFibroblast-like\ncells\nMast cells\nMonocytes and\nmacrophages\nPMNs\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nSS\nMPNST\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nOther\na\nFig. 1 | A machine-learning framework for large-scale identification and \nvalidation of sarcoma cell states and ecosystems. a, Schematic showing the \nimplementation of EcoTyper in patients with STS.

State 1 (S01) and S02 monocytes/\nmacrophages expressed markers previously associated with M2-like \nmacrophage polarization with distinct expression signatures between \nstates (CLEC5A and SPP1 in S01 monocytes/macrophages and ROMO1 \nand STAB1 in S02 monocytes/macrophages)23–26. In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c). Higher B cell abundance has previously been \nreported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with \nsarcomas18, and a higher abundance of CD69+ activated memory B cells \n(S01) was significantly associated with better outcomes in our training \ncohort and trended toward better outcomes in the validation cohort. \n \na\nCell type\nState abundance\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic cells\nECs\nEpithelial-like cells\nFibroblast-like cells\nMast cells\nMono/mac\nPMNs\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nCo-occurence of cell states\nin sarcoma ecotypes \nEpi\nMac\nDC\nPMN\nEpi\nFib\nEndo\nB\nB\nCD8\nCD8\nMac\nMast\nPMN\nb\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nEpi\nEndo\nB\nCD8\nDC\nMast\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nc\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nC2\nC1\nSarcoma\necotype\nSarcoma\nimmune class\nSarcoma\necotype\nCINSARC\nsignature\nData from TCGA\nData from Chibon et al.\nEcotype\nCell type\nState\nHistology\nLPS\nMPNST\nUPS\nSS\nLMS\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nDistribution of cell-state abundances\nacross sarcoma ecotypes \nComparison of sarcoma ecotypes with\npublished gene expression signatures \nFig. 4 | Discovery of sarcoma multicellular communities. a, Heat map of cell-\nstate abundances across STSs of different histologies from the discovery cohort \nseparated into three SEs.

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d). Patients assigned \nto SE1 seemed to have an intermediate prognosis.

These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c). We observed stable to slightly increased S01 CD8+ T cell \nabundance (Fig. 8f) with a significant decrease in the S01 M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages associated with SE3 after starting \n \na\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n10\n–2\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox DMFS\nhazard ratio\nValidation (microarray)\nValidation (microarray)\nb\nc\nd\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.07\n0.08\nn = 100\nn = 37\nn = 92\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nDMFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.08\n0.04\nn = 90\nn = 44\nn = 77\nFig. 6 | Association of SEs with patient outcomes. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of \nPFS in the training cohort stratified by SE assignment.

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

For b, d, f and g, \npatients were analyzed based on ecotype abundance and all patients were \nincluded in the analysis.\nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nof the APOBEC mutagenesis-related COSMIC signature 2. Previous \nstudies have also associated APOBEC mutagenesis with increased \nimmune infiltration into tumors and improved survival in other can-\ncers52,53. The lower mutational burden and lower APOBEC mutagenesis \nin SE1 may explain the low immune infiltration into these tumors. Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review \nBoards at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Written \ninformed consent was obtained for all samples collected and all data \nincluded in this study.\nTraining cohort\nPre-processed bulk RNA-seq profiles of STSs from TCGA were down-\nloaded60 and scaled to transcripts per million (TPM). BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55).

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Here, we employed EcoTyper, \na machine-learning framework, to identify the fundamental cell states \nand cellular ecosystems that make up sarcomas on a large scale using bulk \ntranscriptomes with clinical annotations. We identified and validated  \n23 sarcoma-specific, transcriptionally defined cell states, many of which \nwere highly prognostic of patient outcomes across independent datasets. \nWe discovered three conserved cellular communities or ecotypes associated \nwith underlying genomic alterations and distinct clinical outcomes.  \nWe show that one ecotype defined by tumor-associated macrophages and \nepithelial-like malignant cells predicts response to immune-checkpoint \ninhibition but not chemotherapy and validate our findings in an \nindependent cohort. Our results may enable identification of patients with \nsoft tissue sarcomas who could benefit from immunotherapy and help \ndevelop new therapeutic strategies.\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are rare and diverse neoplasms that arise \nfrom connective tissues throughout the body in patients of all ages1. \nAlthough surgery can cure many patients with localized disease, nearly \nhalf of patients with large, high-grade STSs develop metastatic dis-\nease2. Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7. In addition, a gene expression \nsignature related to genomic complexity (CINSARC) has been validated \nReceived: 24 June 2023\nAccepted: 8 February 2024\nPublished online: xx xx xxxx\n Check for updates\n1Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 2Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. \n3Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 4Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. \n5Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 6Marie-Josee and Henry R.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18. One SIC characterized by high immune infiltration \nand the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) was associ-\nated with better outcomes in patients with localized sarcomas and \nLocalized STSs\nSurvival\nShorter\nLonger\nTime\nSurvival (%)\nDeconvolution of\ncell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nIdentification of\ntranscriptional\ncell states\nDiscovery of tumor\ncellular ecosystems\n(ecotypes)\nAdvanced STSs\nChemotherapy\ncohort\nImmunotherapy\ntraining cohort\nImmunotherapy\nvalidation cohort\nn = 37\nn = 38\nn = 29\nTraining cohort\n(RNA-seq)\nValidation cohort\n(Microarray)\nn = 299 bulk sarcomas\nn = 310 bulk sarcomas\nBulk RNA-seq profiles of\nSTSs\nCell state identification\nfrom bulk gene expression\nCell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nValidation of cell states\nusing scRNA-seq\nAssociation between cell\nstates and clinical outcomes\nAssociation between ecotypes\nand clinical outcomes\nValidation of ecotypes using\nspatial transcriptomics\nCellular communities based on\nco-occurring cell states\n3 histologies\n19 tumors\n31,760 cells\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic\ncells\nEndothelial\ncells\nEpithelial-like\ncells\nFibroblast-like\ncells\nMast cells\nMonocytes and\nmacrophages\nPMNs\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nSS\nMPNST\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nOther\na\nFig. 1 | A machine-learning framework for large-scale identification and \nvalidation of sarcoma cell states and ecosystems. a, Schematic showing the \nimplementation of EcoTyper in patients with STS.

Cell-type-specific \ngene expression was purified from bulk transcriptomic data before identification \nof transcriptional states for each cell type. Cell states were validated via scRNA-\nseq and the associations between cell-state abundances and patient outcomes \nwere analyzed. SEs were discovered by determining the co-occurrence patterns \nbetween cell states and the spatial distribution of the ecotypes and cell states \nwas validated using spatial transcriptomics. Finally, the association between SEs \nand patient outcomes was analyzed.

This framework has been optimized using \nsimulated tumors to choose the number of cell states that maximizes \nsensitivity and positive predictive value of the cell states discovered \nwhile maintaining the stability of clustering results20. Using this \napproach, we identified two to four cell states per cell type, repre-\nsenting 23 distinct cell states (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 4). We \nthen performed reference-guided recovery of the cell states identified \nin non-LMS STSs from TCGA to estimate the abundance of each cell \nstate in the remaining sarcomas within our training and independent \nvalidation cohorts.\nTo validate the cell states identified from bulk gene expression, \nwe performed scRNA-seq on four LMSs and three UPSs from a total \nof six patients (Supplementary Table 5) and analyzed previously pub-\nlished scRNA-seq from 12 synovial sarcomas (SSs) from ten patients15 \n(Extended Data Fig. 1b). We implemented a hybrid approach, leveraging \ninferred copy-number variation and similarity of single-cell transcrip-\ntomes to bulk sarcoma gene expression to identify malignant and \nnormal cells within our scRNA-seq datasets (Extended Data Fig. 2a–d \nand Supplementary Table 6).

To explore the functions of the identified sarcoma cell states, we \ndefined marker genes for the most abundant cell states present within \nthe scRNA-seq datasets (Supplementary Table 8). Cell-state marker \ngene expression was reproducible across STS histologies profiled by \nscRNA-seq (Fig. 2b). These findings confirm that the EcoTyper frame-\nwork can reliably identify the fundamental cell states within STSs.\nWe next annotated each cell state based on the cell-state marker \ngenes identified by RNA-seq and scRNA-seq when available.

Patient \nsurvival, histologies and cell-state abundances used in the analysis of the training \nand validation cohorts are shown in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, respectively. \nOnly patients with available survival data were included in the analysis.\nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ntumor-associated macrophages. State 1 (S01) and S02 monocytes/\nmacrophages expressed markers previously associated with M2-like \nmacrophage polarization with distinct expression signatures between \nstates (CLEC5A and SPP1 in S01 monocytes/macrophages and ROMO1 \nand STAB1 in S02 monocytes/macrophages)23–26. In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c). Higher B cell abundance has previously been \nreported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with \nsarcomas18, and a higher abundance of CD69+ activated memory B cells \n(S01) was significantly associated with better outcomes in our training \ncohort and trended toward better outcomes in the validation cohort. \n \na\nCell type\nState abundance\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic cells\nECs\nEpithelial-like cells\nFibroblast-like cells\nMast cells\nMono/mac\nPMNs\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nCo-occurence of cell states\nin sarcoma ecotypes \nEpi\nMac\nDC\nPMN\nEpi\nFib\nEndo\nB\nB\nCD8\nCD8\nMac\nMast\nPMN\nb\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nEpi\nEndo\nB\nCD8\nDC\nMast\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nc\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nC2\nC1\nSarcoma\necotype\nSarcoma\nimmune class\nSarcoma\necotype\nCINSARC\nsignature\nData from TCGA\nData from Chibon et al.\nEcotype\nCell type\nState\nHistology\nLPS\nMPNST\nUPS\nSS\nLMS\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nDistribution of cell-state abundances\nacross sarcoma ecotypes \nComparison of sarcoma ecotypes with\npublished gene expression signatures \nFig. 4 | Discovery of sarcoma multicellular communities. a, Heat map of cell-\nstate abundances across STSs of different histologies from the discovery cohort \nseparated into three SEs.

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d).

These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c). We observed stable to slightly increased S01 CD8+ T cell \nabundance (Fig. 8f) with a significant decrease in the S01 M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages associated with SE3 after starting \n \na\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n10\n–2\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox DMFS\nhazard ratio\nValidation (microarray)\nValidation (microarray)\nb\nc\nd\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.07\n0.08\nn = 100\nn = 37\nn = 92\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nDMFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.08\n0.04\nn = 90\nn = 44\nn = 77\nFig. 6 | Association of SEs with patient outcomes. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of \nPFS in the training cohort stratified by SE assignment.

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

Previous \nstudies have also associated APOBEC mutagenesis with increased \nimmune infiltration into tumors and improved survival in other can-\ncers52,53. The lower mutational burden and lower APOBEC mutagenesis \nin SE1 may explain the low immune infiltration into these tumors. Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review \nBoards at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Written \ninformed consent was obtained for all samples collected and all data \nincluded in this study.\nTraining cohort\nPre-processed bulk RNA-seq profiles of STSs from TCGA were down-\nloaded60 and scaled to transcripts per million (TPM). BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies.

A completed phase I trial\n(NCT00556881) of the anti-CTLA-4 drug ipilimumab in\nchildren and adolescents with treatment-resistant cancer\nincluded sarcomas, but no results have been reported yet. A\nsecond phase II study (NCT00140855) involving ipilimumab for\npatients with synovial sarcoma was stopped early due to poor\naccrual and no objective responses.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma. Thus, it is of great importance to\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 6 | Relationship between the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation in sarcoma and pancancer.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Here, we employed EcoTyper, \na machine-learning framework, to identify the fundamental cell states \nand cellular ecosystems that make up sarcomas on a large scale using bulk \ntranscriptomes with clinical annotations. We identified and validated  \n23 sarcoma-specific, transcriptionally defined cell states, many of which \nwere highly prognostic of patient outcomes across independent datasets. \nWe discovered three conserved cellular communities or ecotypes associated \nwith underlying genomic alterations and distinct clinical outcomes.  \nWe show that one ecotype defined by tumor-associated macrophages and \nepithelial-like malignant cells predicts response to immune-checkpoint \ninhibition but not chemotherapy and validate our findings in an \nindependent cohort. Our results may enable identification of patients with \nsoft tissue sarcomas who could benefit from immunotherapy and help \ndevelop new therapeutic strategies.\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are rare and diverse neoplasms that arise \nfrom connective tissues throughout the body in patients of all ages1. \nAlthough surgery can cure many patients with localized disease, nearly \nhalf of patients with large, high-grade STSs develop metastatic dis-\nease2. Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7. In addition, a gene expression \nsignature related to genomic complexity (CINSARC) has been validated \nReceived: 24 June 2023\nAccepted: 8 February 2024\nPublished online: xx xx xxxx\n Check for updates\n1Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 2Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. \n3Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 4Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. \n5Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 6Marie-Josee and Henry R.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18.

Cell states and ecotypes were \ninitially discovered in a training cohort of patients with localized STS profiled \nwith RNA-seq followed by validation in a separate cohort of patients with \nlocalized STS with gene expression analyzed by microarray. Cell-type-specific \ngene expression was purified from bulk transcriptomic data before identification \nof transcriptional states for each cell type. Cell states were validated via scRNA-\nseq and the associations between cell-state abundances and patient outcomes \nwere analyzed. SEs were discovered by determining the co-occurrence patterns \nbetween cell states and the spatial distribution of the ecotypes and cell states \nwas validated using spatial transcriptomics. Finally, the association between SEs \nand patient outcomes was analyzed. Three cohorts of patients with advanced \nSTS were analyzed with bulk RNA-seq, including two independent cohorts of \npatients treated with ICI and a cohort of patients treated with standard-of-care \ncytotoxic chemotherapy.

This framework has been optimized using \nsimulated tumors to choose the number of cell states that maximizes \nsensitivity and positive predictive value of the cell states discovered \nwhile maintaining the stability of clustering results20. Using this \napproach, we identified two to four cell states per cell type, repre-\nsenting 23 distinct cell states (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 4). We \nthen performed reference-guided recovery of the cell states identified \nin non-LMS STSs from TCGA to estimate the abundance of each cell \nstate in the remaining sarcomas within our training and independent \nvalidation cohorts.\nTo validate the cell states identified from bulk gene expression, \nwe performed scRNA-seq on four LMSs and three UPSs from a total \nof six patients (Supplementary Table 5) and analyzed previously pub-\nlished scRNA-seq from 12 synovial sarcomas (SSs) from ten patients15 \n(Extended Data Fig. 1b).

Most of the cell states that were not significantly \nrecovered were not represented or had low abundance in our scRNA-seq \ndata. To explore the functions of the identified sarcoma cell states, we \ndefined marker genes for the most abundant cell states present within \nthe scRNA-seq datasets (Supplementary Table 8). Cell-state marker \ngene expression was reproducible across STS histologies profiled by \nscRNA-seq (Fig. 2b). These findings confirm that the EcoTyper frame-\nwork can reliably identify the fundamental cell states within STSs.\nWe next annotated each cell state based on the cell-state marker \ngenes identified by RNA-seq and scRNA-seq when available. To aid in \nthe annotation of malignant cell states, we calculated the overlap of \nmarker genes identified from bulk RNA-seq with the Molecular Signa-\ntures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene sets (Supplementary Table 9). \nAll cell-state annotations and key marker genes are displayed in Sup-\nplementary Table 10.

State 1 (S01) and S02 monocytes/\nmacrophages expressed markers previously associated with M2-like \nmacrophage polarization with distinct expression signatures between \nstates (CLEC5A and SPP1 in S01 monocytes/macrophages and ROMO1 \nand STAB1 in S02 monocytes/macrophages)23–26. In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c). Higher B cell abundance has previously been \nreported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with \nsarcomas18, and a higher abundance of CD69+ activated memory B cells \n(S01) was significantly associated with better outcomes in our training \ncohort and trended toward better outcomes in the validation cohort. \n \na\nCell type\nState abundance\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic cells\nECs\nEpithelial-like cells\nFibroblast-like cells\nMast cells\nMono/mac\nPMNs\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nCo-occurence of cell states\nin sarcoma ecotypes \nEpi\nMac\nDC\nPMN\nEpi\nFib\nEndo\nB\nB\nCD8\nCD8\nMac\nMast\nPMN\nb\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nEpi\nEndo\nB\nCD8\nDC\nMast\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nc\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nC2\nC1\nSarcoma\necotype\nSarcoma\nimmune class\nSarcoma\necotype\nCINSARC\nsignature\nData from TCGA\nData from Chibon et al.\nEcotype\nCell type\nState\nHistology\nLPS\nMPNST\nUPS\nSS\nLMS\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nDistribution of cell-state abundances\nacross sarcoma ecotypes \nComparison of sarcoma ecotypes with\npublished gene expression signatures \nFig. 4 | Discovery of sarcoma multicellular communities. a, Heat map of cell-\nstate abundances across STSs of different histologies from the discovery cohort \nseparated into three SEs.

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d). Patients assigned \nto SE1 seemed to have an intermediate prognosis.

These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c). We observed stable to slightly increased S01 CD8+ T cell \nabundance (Fig. 8f) with a significant decrease in the S01 M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages associated with SE3 after starting \n \na\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n10\n–2\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox DMFS\nhazard ratio\nValidation (microarray)\nValidation (microarray)\nb\nc\nd\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.07\n0.08\nn = 100\nn = 37\nn = 92\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nDMFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.08\n0.04\nn = 90\nn = 44\nn = 77\nFig. 6 | Association of SEs with patient outcomes. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of \nPFS in the training cohort stratified by SE assignment.

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

Previous \nstudies have also associated APOBEC mutagenesis with increased \nimmune infiltration into tumors and improved survival in other can-\ncers52,53. The lower mutational burden and lower APOBEC mutagenesis \nin SE1 may explain the low immune infiltration into these tumors. Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki.

BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

A completed phase I trial\n(NCT00556881) of the anti-CTLA-4 drug ipilimumab in\nchildren and adolescents with treatment-resistant cancer\nincluded sarcomas, but no results have been reported yet. A\nsecond phase II study (NCT00140855) involving ipilimumab for\npatients with synovial sarcoma was stopped early due to poor\naccrual and no objective responses.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma. Thus, it is of great importance to\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 6 | Relationship between the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation in sarcoma and pancancer.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Here, we employed EcoTyper, \na machine-learning framework, to identify the fundamental cell states \nand cellular ecosystems that make up sarcomas on a large scale using bulk \ntranscriptomes with clinical annotations. We identified and validated  \n23 sarcoma-specific, transcriptionally defined cell states, many of which \nwere highly prognostic of patient outcomes across independent datasets. \nWe discovered three conserved cellular communities or ecotypes associated \nwith underlying genomic alterations and distinct clinical outcomes.  \nWe show that one ecotype defined by tumor-associated macrophages and \nepithelial-like malignant cells predicts response to immune-checkpoint \ninhibition but not chemotherapy and validate our findings in an \nindependent cohort. Our results may enable identification of patients with \nsoft tissue sarcomas who could benefit from immunotherapy and help \ndevelop new therapeutic strategies.\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are rare and diverse neoplasms that arise \nfrom connective tissues throughout the body in patients of all ages1. \nAlthough surgery can cure many patients with localized disease, nearly \nhalf of patients with large, high-grade STSs develop metastatic dis-\nease2. Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18. One SIC characterized by high immune infiltration \nand the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) was associ-\nated with better outcomes in patients with localized sarcomas and \nLocalized STSs\nSurvival\nShorter\nLonger\nTime\nSurvival (%)\nDeconvolution of\ncell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nIdentification of\ntranscriptional\ncell states\nDiscovery of tumor\ncellular ecosystems\n(ecotypes)\nAdvanced STSs\nChemotherapy\ncohort\nImmunotherapy\ntraining cohort\nImmunotherapy\nvalidation cohort\nn = 37\nn = 38\nn = 29\nTraining cohort\n(RNA-seq)\nValidation cohort\n(Microarray)\nn = 299 bulk sarcomas\nn = 310 bulk sarcomas\nBulk RNA-seq profiles of\nSTSs\nCell state identification\nfrom bulk gene expression\nCell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nValidation of cell states\nusing scRNA-seq\nAssociation between cell\nstates and clinical outcomes\nAssociation between ecotypes\nand clinical outcomes\nValidation of ecotypes using\nspatial transcriptomics\nCellular communities based on\nco-occurring cell states\n3 histologies\n19 tumors\n31,760 cells\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic\ncells\nEndothelial\ncells\nEpithelial-like\ncells\nFibroblast-like\ncells\nMast cells\nMonocytes and\nmacrophages\nPMNs\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nSS\nMPNST\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nOther\na\nFig. 1 | A machine-learning framework for large-scale identification and \nvalidation of sarcoma cell states and ecosystems. a, Schematic showing the \nimplementation of EcoTyper in patients with STS.

To aid in \nthe annotation of malignant cell states, we calculated the overlap of \nmarker genes identified from bulk RNA-seq with the Molecular Signa-\ntures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene sets (Supplementary Table 9). \nAll cell-state annotations and key marker genes are displayed in Sup-\nplementary Table 10.

State 1 (S01) and S02 monocytes/\nmacrophages expressed markers previously associated with M2-like \nmacrophage polarization with distinct expression signatures between \nstates (CLEC5A and SPP1 in S01 monocytes/macrophages and ROMO1 \nand STAB1 in S02 monocytes/macrophages)23–26. In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c). Higher B cell abundance has previously been \nreported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with \nsarcomas18, and a higher abundance of CD69+ activated memory B cells \n(S01) was significantly associated with better outcomes in our training \ncohort and trended toward better outcomes in the validation cohort. \n \na\nCell type\nState abundance\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic cells\nECs\nEpithelial-like cells\nFibroblast-like cells\nMast cells\nMono/mac\nPMNs\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nCo-occurence of cell states\nin sarcoma ecotypes \nEpi\nMac\nDC\nPMN\nEpi\nFib\nEndo\nB\nB\nCD8\nCD8\nMac\nMast\nPMN\nb\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nEpi\nEndo\nB\nCD8\nDC\nMast\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nc\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nC2\nC1\nSarcoma\necotype\nSarcoma\nimmune class\nSarcoma\necotype\nCINSARC\nsignature\nData from TCGA\nData from Chibon et al.\nEcotype\nCell type\nState\nHistology\nLPS\nMPNST\nUPS\nSS\nLMS\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nDistribution of cell-state abundances\nacross sarcoma ecotypes \nComparison of sarcoma ecotypes with\npublished gene expression signatures \nFig. 4 | Discovery of sarcoma multicellular communities. a, Heat map of cell-\nstate abundances across STSs of different histologies from the discovery cohort \nseparated into three SEs.

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d).

These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c).

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

Previous \nstudies have also associated APOBEC mutagenesis with increased \nimmune infiltration into tumors and improved survival in other can-\ncers52,53. The lower mutational burden and lower APOBEC mutagenesis \nin SE1 may explain the low immune infiltration into these tumors. Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review \nBoards at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Written \ninformed consent was obtained for all samples collected and all data \nincluded in this study.\nTraining cohort\nPre-processed bulk RNA-seq profiles of STSs from TCGA were down-\nloaded60 and scaled to transcripts per million (TPM). BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55).

High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Here, we employed EcoTyper, \na machine-learning framework, to identify the fundamental cell states \nand cellular ecosystems that make up sarcomas on a large scale using bulk \ntranscriptomes with clinical annotations. We identified and validated  \n23 sarcoma-specific, transcriptionally defined cell states, many of which \nwere highly prognostic of patient outcomes across independent datasets. \nWe discovered three conserved cellular communities or ecotypes associated \nwith underlying genomic alterations and distinct clinical outcomes.  \nWe show that one ecotype defined by tumor-associated macrophages and \nepithelial-like malignant cells predicts response to immune-checkpoint \ninhibition but not chemotherapy and validate our findings in an \nindependent cohort. Our results may enable identification of patients with \nsoft tissue sarcomas who could benefit from immunotherapy and help \ndevelop new therapeutic strategies.\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are rare and diverse neoplasms that arise \nfrom connective tissues throughout the body in patients of all ages1. \nAlthough surgery can cure many patients with localized disease, nearly \nhalf of patients with large, high-grade STSs develop metastatic dis-\nease2. Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18. One SIC characterized by high immune infiltration \nand the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) was associ-\nated with better outcomes in patients with localized sarcomas and \nLocalized STSs\nSurvival\nShorter\nLonger\nTime\nSurvival (%)\nDeconvolution of\ncell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nIdentification of\ntranscriptional\ncell states\nDiscovery of tumor\ncellular ecosystems\n(ecotypes)\nAdvanced STSs\nChemotherapy\ncohort\nImmunotherapy\ntraining cohort\nImmunotherapy\nvalidation cohort\nn = 37\nn = 38\nn = 29\nTraining cohort\n(RNA-seq)\nValidation cohort\n(Microarray)\nn = 299 bulk sarcomas\nn = 310 bulk sarcomas\nBulk RNA-seq profiles of\nSTSs\nCell state identification\nfrom bulk gene expression\nCell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nValidation of cell states\nusing scRNA-seq\nAssociation between cell\nstates and clinical outcomes\nAssociation between ecotypes\nand clinical outcomes\nValidation of ecotypes using\nspatial transcriptomics\nCellular communities based on\nco-occurring cell states\n3 histologies\n19 tumors\n31,760 cells\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic\ncells\nEndothelial\ncells\nEpithelial-like\ncells\nFibroblast-like\ncells\nMast cells\nMonocytes and\nmacrophages\nPMNs\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nSS\nMPNST\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nOther\na\nFig. 1 | A machine-learning framework for large-scale identification and \nvalidation of sarcoma cell states and ecosystems. a, Schematic showing the \nimplementation of EcoTyper in patients with STS.

In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c). Higher B cell abundance has previously been \nreported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with \nsarcomas18, and a higher abundance of CD69+ activated memory B cells \n(S01) was significantly associated with better outcomes in our training \ncohort and trended toward better outcomes in the validation cohort. \n \na\nCell type\nState abundance\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic cells\nECs\nEpithelial-like cells\nFibroblast-like cells\nMast cells\nMono/mac\nPMNs\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nCo-occurence of cell states\nin sarcoma ecotypes \nEpi\nMac\nDC\nPMN\nEpi\nFib\nEndo\nB\nB\nCD8\nCD8\nMac\nMast\nPMN\nb\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nEpi\nEndo\nB\nCD8\nDC\nMast\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nc\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nC2\nC1\nSarcoma\necotype\nSarcoma\nimmune class\nSarcoma\necotype\nCINSARC\nsignature\nData from TCGA\nData from Chibon et al.\nEcotype\nCell type\nState\nHistology\nLPS\nMPNST\nUPS\nSS\nLMS\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nDistribution of cell-state abundances\nacross sarcoma ecotypes \nComparison of sarcoma ecotypes with\npublished gene expression signatures \nFig. 4 | Discovery of sarcoma multicellular communities. a, Heat map of cell-\nstate abundances across STSs of different histologies from the discovery cohort \nseparated into three SEs.

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d). Patients assigned \nto SE1 seemed to have an intermediate prognosis.

These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c).

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

Previous \nstudies have also associated APOBEC mutagenesis with increased \nimmune infiltration into tumors and improved survival in other can-\ncers52,53. The lower mutational burden and lower APOBEC mutagenesis \nin SE1 may explain the low immune infiltration into these tumors. Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review \nBoards at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Written \ninformed consent was obtained for all samples collected and all data \nincluded in this study.\nTraining cohort\nPre-processed bulk RNA-seq profiles of STSs from TCGA were down-\nloaded60 and scaled to transcripts per million (TPM). BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma.

High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Our results may enable identification of patients with \nsoft tissue sarcomas who could benefit from immunotherapy and help \ndevelop new therapeutic strategies.\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are rare and diverse neoplasms that arise \nfrom connective tissues throughout the body in patients of all ages1. \nAlthough surgery can cure many patients with localized disease, nearly \nhalf of patients with large, high-grade STSs develop metastatic dis-\nease2. Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7. In addition, a gene expression \nsignature related to genomic complexity (CINSARC) has been validated \nReceived: 24 June 2023\nAccepted: 8 February 2024\nPublished online: xx xx xxxx\n Check for updates\n1Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 2Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. \n3Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 4Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. \n5Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 6Marie-Josee and Henry R.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18. One SIC characterized by high immune infiltration \nand the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) was associ-\nated with better outcomes in patients with localized sarcomas and \nLocalized STSs\nSurvival\nShorter\nLonger\nTime\nSurvival (%)\nDeconvolution of\ncell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nIdentification of\ntranscriptional\ncell states\nDiscovery of tumor\ncellular ecosystems\n(ecotypes)\nAdvanced STSs\nChemotherapy\ncohort\nImmunotherapy\ntraining cohort\nImmunotherapy\nvalidation cohort\nn = 37\nn = 38\nn = 29\nTraining cohort\n(RNA-seq)\nValidation cohort\n(Microarray)\nn = 299 bulk sarcomas\nn = 310 bulk sarcomas\nBulk RNA-seq profiles of\nSTSs\nCell state identification\nfrom bulk gene expression\nCell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nValidation of cell states\nusing scRNA-seq\nAssociation between cell\nstates and clinical outcomes\nAssociation between ecotypes\nand clinical outcomes\nValidation of ecotypes using\nspatial transcriptomics\nCellular communities based on\nco-occurring cell states\n3 histologies\n19 tumors\n31,760 cells\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic\ncells\nEndothelial\ncells\nEpithelial-like\ncells\nFibroblast-like\ncells\nMast cells\nMonocytes and\nmacrophages\nPMNs\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nSS\nMPNST\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nOther\na\nFig. 1 | A machine-learning framework for large-scale identification and \nvalidation of sarcoma cell states and ecosystems. a, Schematic showing the \nimplementation of EcoTyper in patients with STS.

To explore the functions of the identified sarcoma cell states, we \ndefined marker genes for the most abundant cell states present within \nthe scRNA-seq datasets (Supplementary Table 8). Cell-state marker \ngene expression was reproducible across STS histologies profiled by \nscRNA-seq (Fig. 2b).

State 1 (S01) and S02 monocytes/\nmacrophages expressed markers previously associated with M2-like \nmacrophage polarization with distinct expression signatures between \nstates (CLEC5A and SPP1 in S01 monocytes/macrophages and ROMO1 \nand STAB1 in S02 monocytes/macrophages)23–26. In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c). Higher B cell abundance has previously been \nreported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with \nsarcomas18, and a higher abundance of CD69+ activated memory B cells \n(S01) was significantly associated with better outcomes in our training \ncohort and trended toward better outcomes in the validation cohort. \n \na\nCell type\nState abundance\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic cells\nECs\nEpithelial-like cells\nFibroblast-like cells\nMast cells\nMono/mac\nPMNs\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nCo-occurence of cell states\nin sarcoma ecotypes \nEpi\nMac\nDC\nPMN\nEpi\nFib\nEndo\nB\nB\nCD8\nCD8\nMac\nMast\nPMN\nb\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nEpi\nEndo\nB\nCD8\nDC\nMast\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nc\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nC2\nC1\nSarcoma\necotype\nSarcoma\nimmune class\nSarcoma\necotype\nCINSARC\nsignature\nData from TCGA\nData from Chibon et al.\nEcotype\nCell type\nState\nHistology\nLPS\nMPNST\nUPS\nSS\nLMS\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nDistribution of cell-state abundances\nacross sarcoma ecotypes \nComparison of sarcoma ecotypes with\npublished gene expression signatures \nFig. 4 | Discovery of sarcoma multicellular communities. a, Heat map of cell-\nstate abundances across STSs of different histologies from the discovery cohort \nseparated into three SEs.

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d). Patients assigned \nto SE1 seemed to have an intermediate prognosis.

These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c). We observed stable to slightly increased S01 CD8+ T cell \nabundance (Fig. 8f) with a significant decrease in the S01 M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages associated with SE3 after starting \n \na\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n10\n–2\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox DMFS\nhazard ratio\nValidation (microarray)\nValidation (microarray)\nb\nc\nd\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.07\n0.08\nn = 100\nn = 37\nn = 92\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nDMFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.08\n0.04\nn = 90\nn = 44\nn = 77\nFig. 6 | Association of SEs with patient outcomes. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of \nPFS in the training cohort stratified by SE assignment.

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

Previous \nstudies have also associated APOBEC mutagenesis with increased \nimmune infiltration into tumors and improved survival in other can-\ncers52,53. The lower mutational burden and lower APOBEC mutagenesis \nin SE1 may explain the low immune infiltration into these tumors. Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Boxes show median and quartiles, and whiskers \nextend to the minimum and maximum value. f,g, Pre-Tx and on-Tx abundance \nof S01 CD8+ T cells (f) and S01 monocytes/macrophages (g) in the ICI validation \ncohort (n = 19 paired samples).

Patient Tx response, ecotype assignments \nand ecotype abundances used in the ICI validation cohort analysis are shown \nin Supplementary Table 21. For a, patients were analyzed based on ecotype \nassignment and patients not assigned to an ecotype were not included. For b \nand c, patients were analyzed based on ecotype abundance and all patients were \nincluded in the analysis.\nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nand LMS. Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review \nBoards at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Written \ninformed consent was obtained for all samples collected and all data \nincluded in this study.\nTraining cohort\nPre-processed bulk RNA-seq profiles of STSs from TCGA were down-\nloaded60 and scaled to transcripts per million (TPM). BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Here, we employed EcoTyper, \na machine-learning framework, to identify the fundamental cell states \nand cellular ecosystems that make up sarcomas on a large scale using bulk \ntranscriptomes with clinical annotations. We identified and validated  \n23 sarcoma-specific, transcriptionally defined cell states, many of which \nwere highly prognostic of patient outcomes across independent datasets. \nWe discovered three conserved cellular communities or ecotypes associated \nwith underlying genomic alterations and distinct clinical outcomes.  \nWe show that one ecotype defined by tumor-associated macrophages and \nepithelial-like malignant cells predicts response to immune-checkpoint \ninhibition but not chemotherapy and validate our findings in an \nindependent cohort. Our results may enable identification of patients with \nsoft tissue sarcomas who could benefit from immunotherapy and help \ndevelop new therapeutic strategies.\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are rare and diverse neoplasms that arise \nfrom connective tissues throughout the body in patients of all ages1. \nAlthough surgery can cure many patients with localized disease, nearly \nhalf of patients with large, high-grade STSs develop metastatic dis-\nease2. Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18.

We implemented a hybrid approach, leveraging \ninferred copy-number variation and similarity of single-cell transcrip-\ntomes to bulk sarcoma gene expression to identify malignant and \nnormal cells within our scRNA-seq datasets (Extended Data Fig. 2a–d \nand Supplementary Table 6).

To explore the functions of the identified sarcoma cell states, we \ndefined marker genes for the most abundant cell states present within \nthe scRNA-seq datasets (Supplementary Table 8). Cell-state marker \ngene expression was reproducible across STS histologies profiled by \nscRNA-seq (Fig. 2b). These findings confirm that the EcoTyper frame-\nwork can reliably identify the fundamental cell states within STSs.\nWe next annotated each cell state based on the cell-state marker \ngenes identified by RNA-seq and scRNA-seq when available.

Patient \nsurvival, histologies and cell-state abundances used in the analysis of the training \nand validation cohorts are shown in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, respectively. \nOnly patients with available survival data were included in the analysis.\nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ntumor-associated macrophages. State 1 (S01) and S02 monocytes/\nmacrophages expressed markers previously associated with M2-like \nmacrophage polarization with distinct expression signatures between \nstates (CLEC5A and SPP1 in S01 monocytes/macrophages and ROMO1 \nand STAB1 in S02 monocytes/macrophages)23–26. In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c). Higher B cell abundance has previously been \nreported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with \nsarcomas18, and a higher abundance of CD69+ activated memory B cells \n(S01) was significantly associated with better outcomes in our training \ncohort and trended toward better outcomes in the validation cohort. \n \na\nCell type\nState abundance\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic cells\nECs\nEpithelial-like cells\nFibroblast-like cells\nMast cells\nMono/mac\nPMNs\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nCo-occurence of cell states\nin sarcoma ecotypes \nEpi\nMac\nDC\nPMN\nEpi\nFib\nEndo\nB\nB\nCD8\nCD8\nMac\nMast\nPMN\nb\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nEpi\nEndo\nB\nCD8\nDC\nMast\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nc\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nC2\nC1\nSarcoma\necotype\nSarcoma\nimmune class\nSarcoma\necotype\nCINSARC\nsignature\nData from TCGA\nData from Chibon et al.\nEcotype\nCell type\nState\nHistology\nLPS\nMPNST\nUPS\nSS\nLMS\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nDistribution of cell-state abundances\nacross sarcoma ecotypes \nComparison of sarcoma ecotypes with\npublished gene expression signatures \nFig. 4 | Discovery of sarcoma multicellular communities. a, Heat map of cell-\nstate abundances across STSs of different histologies from the discovery cohort \nseparated into three SEs.

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d).

These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c). We observed stable to slightly increased S01 CD8+ T cell \nabundance (Fig. 8f) with a significant decrease in the S01 M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages associated with SE3 after starting \n \na\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n10\n–2\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox DMFS\nhazard ratio\nValidation (microarray)\nValidation (microarray)\nb\nc\nd\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.07\n0.08\nn = 100\nn = 37\nn = 92\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nDMFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.08\n0.04\nn = 90\nn = 44\nn = 77\nFig. 6 | Association of SEs with patient outcomes. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of \nPFS in the training cohort stratified by SE assignment.

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

Previous \nstudies have also associated APOBEC mutagenesis with increased \nimmune infiltration into tumors and improved survival in other can-\ncers52,53. The lower mutational burden and lower APOBEC mutagenesis \nin SE1 may explain the low immune infiltration into these tumors. Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review \nBoards at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Written \ninformed consent was obtained for all samples collected and all data \nincluded in this study.\nTraining cohort\nPre-processed bulk RNA-seq profiles of STSs from TCGA were down-\nloaded60 and scaled to transcripts per million (TPM). BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies.

A completed phase I trial\n(NCT00556881) of the anti-CTLA-4 drug ipilimumab in\nchildren and adolescents with treatment-resistant cancer\nincluded sarcomas, but no results have been reported yet. A\nsecond phase II study (NCT00140855) involving ipilimumab for\npatients with synovial sarcoma was stopped early due to poor\naccrual and no objective responses.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma. Thus, it is of great importance to\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 6 | Relationship between the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation in sarcoma and pancancer.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Here, we employed EcoTyper, \na machine-learning framework, to identify the fundamental cell states \nand cellular ecosystems that make up sarcomas on a large scale using bulk \ntranscriptomes with clinical annotations. We identified and validated  \n23 sarcoma-specific, transcriptionally defined cell states, many of which \nwere highly prognostic of patient outcomes across independent datasets. \nWe discovered three conserved cellular communities or ecotypes associated \nwith underlying genomic alterations and distinct clinical outcomes.  \nWe show that one ecotype defined by tumor-associated macrophages and \nepithelial-like malignant cells predicts response to immune-checkpoint \ninhibition but not chemotherapy and validate our findings in an \nindependent cohort. Our results may enable identification of patients with \nsoft tissue sarcomas who could benefit from immunotherapy and help \ndevelop new therapeutic strategies.\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are rare and diverse neoplasms that arise \nfrom connective tissues throughout the body in patients of all ages1. \nAlthough surgery can cure many patients with localized disease, nearly \nhalf of patients with large, high-grade STSs develop metastatic dis-\nease2. Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7. In addition, a gene expression \nsignature related to genomic complexity (CINSARC) has been validated \nReceived: 24 June 2023\nAccepted: 8 February 2024\nPublished online: xx xx xxxx\n Check for updates\n1Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 2Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. \n3Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 4Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. \n5Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 6Marie-Josee and Henry R.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18. One SIC characterized by high immune infiltration \nand the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) was associ-\nated with better outcomes in patients with localized sarcomas and \nLocalized STSs\nSurvival\nShorter\nLonger\nTime\nSurvival (%)\nDeconvolution of\ncell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nIdentification of\ntranscriptional\ncell states\nDiscovery of tumor\ncellular ecosystems\n(ecotypes)\nAdvanced STSs\nChemotherapy\ncohort\nImmunotherapy\ntraining cohort\nImmunotherapy\nvalidation cohort\nn = 37\nn = 38\nn = 29\nTraining cohort\n(RNA-seq)\nValidation cohort\n(Microarray)\nn = 299 bulk sarcomas\nn = 310 bulk sarcomas\nBulk RNA-seq profiles of\nSTSs\nCell state identification\nfrom bulk gene expression\nCell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nValidation of cell states\nusing scRNA-seq\nAssociation between cell\nstates and clinical outcomes\nAssociation between ecotypes\nand clinical outcomes\nValidation of ecotypes using\nspatial transcriptomics\nCellular communities based on\nco-occurring cell states\n3 histologies\n19 tumors\n31,760 cells\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic\ncells\nEndothelial\ncells\nEpithelial-like\ncells\nFibroblast-like\ncells\nMast cells\nMonocytes and\nmacrophages\nPMNs\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nSS\nMPNST\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nOther\na\nFig. 1 | A machine-learning framework for large-scale identification and \nvalidation of sarcoma cell states and ecosystems. a, Schematic showing the \nimplementation of EcoTyper in patients with STS.

Finally, the association between SEs \nand patient outcomes was analyzed.

To explore the functions of the identified sarcoma cell states, we \ndefined marker genes for the most abundant cell states present within \nthe scRNA-seq datasets (Supplementary Table 8). Cell-state marker \ngene expression was reproducible across STS histologies profiled by \nscRNA-seq (Fig. 2b).

State 1 (S01) and S02 monocytes/\nmacrophages expressed markers previously associated with M2-like \nmacrophage polarization with distinct expression signatures between \nstates (CLEC5A and SPP1 in S01 monocytes/macrophages and ROMO1 \nand STAB1 in S02 monocytes/macrophages)23–26. In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c).

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d). Patients assigned \nto SE1 seemed to have an intermediate prognosis.

These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c). We observed stable to slightly increased S01 CD8+ T cell \nabundance (Fig. 8f) with a significant decrease in the S01 M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages associated with SE3 after starting \n \na\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n10\n–2\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox DMFS\nhazard ratio\nValidation (microarray)\nValidation (microarray)\nb\nc\nd\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.07\n0.08\nn = 100\nn = 37\nn = 92\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nDMFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.08\n0.04\nn = 90\nn = 44\nn = 77\nFig. 6 | Association of SEs with patient outcomes. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of \nPFS in the training cohort stratified by SE assignment.

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review \nBoards at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Written \ninformed consent was obtained for all samples collected and all data \nincluded in this study.\nTraining cohort\nPre-processed bulk RNA-seq profiles of STSs from TCGA were down-\nloaded60 and scaled to transcripts per million (TPM). BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Logical Structure: 4/5**\n- **Assessment**: The protocol is generally well-organized, with a clear sequence that follows the outlined objectives. Each section logically progresses from expression analysis in sarcoma to pan-cancer datasets and finally correlating ICL expression with survival outcomes.\n- **Improvement Suggestions**: To enhance clarity, consider adding subheadings within each section to delineate specific steps or analyses. For example, under \"Expression Analysis of ICLs in Sarcoma Compared to Normal Tissues,\" subheadings could include \"Data Collection,\" \"Statistical Analysis,\" and \"Interpretation of Results.\"\n\n**2. Detail Level: 3/5**\n- **Assessment**: While the protocol provides a decent overview of the methods, it lacks sufficient detail in some areas that are crucial for replication. For instance, specific statistical tests used for correlation analysis and survival analysis are mentioned but not elaborated upon.\n- **Improvement Suggestions**: Include more detailed descriptions of the statistical methods, such as the exact tests used (e.g., Cox proportional hazards model for survival analysis) and any software or tools employed for analysis. Additionally, specify the criteria for selecting the cancer types included in the pan-cancer analysis.\n\n**3. Factual Reliability: 4/5**\n- **Assessment**: The procedures and information provided appear accurate and align with standard practices in bioinformatics and cancer research.

Here, we employed EcoTyper, \na machine-learning framework, to identify the fundamental cell states \nand cellular ecosystems that make up sarcomas on a large scale using bulk \ntranscriptomes with clinical annotations. We identified and validated  \n23 sarcoma-specific, transcriptionally defined cell states, many of which \nwere highly prognostic of patient outcomes across independent datasets. \nWe discovered three conserved cellular communities or ecotypes associated \nwith underlying genomic alterations and distinct clinical outcomes.  \nWe show that one ecotype defined by tumor-associated macrophages and \nepithelial-like malignant cells predicts response to immune-checkpoint \ninhibition but not chemotherapy and validate our findings in an \nindependent cohort. Our results may enable identification of patients with \nsoft tissue sarcomas who could benefit from immunotherapy and help \ndevelop new therapeutic strategies.\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are rare and diverse neoplasms that arise \nfrom connective tissues throughout the body in patients of all ages1. \nAlthough surgery can cure many patients with localized disease, nearly \nhalf of patients with large, high-grade STSs develop metastatic dis-\nease2. Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18. One SIC characterized by high immune infiltration \nand the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) was associ-\nated with better outcomes in patients with localized sarcomas and \nLocalized STSs\nSurvival\nShorter\nLonger\nTime\nSurvival (%)\nDeconvolution of\ncell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nIdentification of\ntranscriptional\ncell states\nDiscovery of tumor\ncellular ecosystems\n(ecotypes)\nAdvanced STSs\nChemotherapy\ncohort\nImmunotherapy\ntraining cohort\nImmunotherapy\nvalidation cohort\nn = 37\nn = 38\nn = 29\nTraining cohort\n(RNA-seq)\nValidation cohort\n(Microarray)\nn = 299 bulk sarcomas\nn = 310 bulk sarcomas\nBulk RNA-seq profiles of\nSTSs\nCell state identification\nfrom bulk gene expression\nCell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nValidation of cell states\nusing scRNA-seq\nAssociation between cell\nstates and clinical outcomes\nAssociation between ecotypes\nand clinical outcomes\nValidation of ecotypes using\nspatial transcriptomics\nCellular communities based on\nco-occurring cell states\n3 histologies\n19 tumors\n31,760 cells\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic\ncells\nEndothelial\ncells\nEpithelial-like\ncells\nFibroblast-like\ncells\nMast cells\nMonocytes and\nmacrophages\nPMNs\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nSS\nMPNST\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nOther\na\nFig. 1 | A machine-learning framework for large-scale identification and \nvalidation of sarcoma cell states and ecosystems. a, Schematic showing the \nimplementation of EcoTyper in patients with STS.

State 1 (S01) and S02 monocytes/\nmacrophages expressed markers previously associated with M2-like \nmacrophage polarization with distinct expression signatures between \nstates (CLEC5A and SPP1 in S01 monocytes/macrophages and ROMO1 \nand STAB1 in S02 monocytes/macrophages)23–26. In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c). Higher B cell abundance has previously been \nreported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with \nsarcomas18, and a higher abundance of CD69+ activated memory B cells \n(S01) was significantly associated with better outcomes in our training \ncohort and trended toward better outcomes in the validation cohort. \n \na\nCell type\nState abundance\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic cells\nECs\nEpithelial-like cells\nFibroblast-like cells\nMast cells\nMono/mac\nPMNs\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nCo-occurence of cell states\nin sarcoma ecotypes \nEpi\nMac\nDC\nPMN\nEpi\nFib\nEndo\nB\nB\nCD8\nCD8\nMac\nMast\nPMN\nb\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nEpi\nEndo\nB\nCD8\nDC\nMast\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nc\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nC2\nC1\nSarcoma\necotype\nSarcoma\nimmune class\nSarcoma\necotype\nCINSARC\nsignature\nData from TCGA\nData from Chibon et al.\nEcotype\nCell type\nState\nHistology\nLPS\nMPNST\nUPS\nSS\nLMS\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nDistribution of cell-state abundances\nacross sarcoma ecotypes \nComparison of sarcoma ecotypes with\npublished gene expression signatures \nFig. 4 | Discovery of sarcoma multicellular communities. a, Heat map of cell-\nstate abundances across STSs of different histologies from the discovery cohort \nseparated into three SEs.

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d).

These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c).

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

Previous \nstudies have also associated APOBEC mutagenesis with increased \nimmune infiltration into tumors and improved survival in other can-\ncers52,53. The lower mutational burden and lower APOBEC mutagenesis \nin SE1 may explain the low immune infiltration into these tumors. Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review \nBoards at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Written \ninformed consent was obtained for all samples collected and all data \nincluded in this study.\nTraining cohort\nPre-processed bulk RNA-seq profiles of STSs from TCGA were down-\nloaded60 and scaled to transcripts per million (TPM). BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55).

High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Here, we employed EcoTyper, \na machine-learning framework, to identify the fundamental cell states \nand cellular ecosystems that make up sarcomas on a large scale using bulk \ntranscriptomes with clinical annotations. We identified and validated  \n23 sarcoma-specific, transcriptionally defined cell states, many of which \nwere highly prognostic of patient outcomes across independent datasets. \nWe discovered three conserved cellular communities or ecotypes associated \nwith underlying genomic alterations and distinct clinical outcomes.  \nWe show that one ecotype defined by tumor-associated macrophages and \nepithelial-like malignant cells predicts response to immune-checkpoint \ninhibition but not chemotherapy and validate our findings in an \nindependent cohort. Our results may enable identification of patients with \nsoft tissue sarcomas who could benefit from immunotherapy and help \ndevelop new therapeutic strategies.\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are rare and diverse neoplasms that arise \nfrom connective tissues throughout the body in patients of all ages1. \nAlthough surgery can cure many patients with localized disease, nearly \nhalf of patients with large, high-grade STSs develop metastatic dis-\nease2. Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18. One SIC characterized by high immune infiltration \nand the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) was associ-\nated with better outcomes in patients with localized sarcomas and \nLocalized STSs\nSurvival\nShorter\nLonger\nTime\nSurvival (%)\nDeconvolution of\ncell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nIdentification of\ntranscriptional\ncell states\nDiscovery of tumor\ncellular ecosystems\n(ecotypes)\nAdvanced STSs\nChemotherapy\ncohort\nImmunotherapy\ntraining cohort\nImmunotherapy\nvalidation cohort\nn = 37\nn = 38\nn = 29\nTraining cohort\n(RNA-seq)\nValidation cohort\n(Microarray)\nn = 299 bulk sarcomas\nn = 310 bulk sarcomas\nBulk RNA-seq profiles of\nSTSs\nCell state identification\nfrom bulk gene expression\nCell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nValidation of cell states\nusing scRNA-seq\nAssociation between cell\nstates and clinical outcomes\nAssociation between ecotypes\nand clinical outcomes\nValidation of ecotypes using\nspatial transcriptomics\nCellular communities based on\nco-occurring cell states\n3 histologies\n19 tumors\n31,760 cells\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic\ncells\nEndothelial\ncells\nEpithelial-like\ncells\nFibroblast-like\ncells\nMast cells\nMonocytes and\nmacrophages\nPMNs\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nSS\nMPNST\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nOther\na\nFig. 1 | A machine-learning framework for large-scale identification and \nvalidation of sarcoma cell states and ecosystems. a, Schematic showing the \nimplementation of EcoTyper in patients with STS.

State 1 (S01) and S02 monocytes/\nmacrophages expressed markers previously associated with M2-like \nmacrophage polarization with distinct expression signatures between \nstates (CLEC5A and SPP1 in S01 monocytes/macrophages and ROMO1 \nand STAB1 in S02 monocytes/macrophages)23–26. In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c). Higher B cell abundance has previously been \nreported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with \nsarcomas18, and a higher abundance of CD69+ activated memory B cells \n(S01) was significantly associated with better outcomes in our training \ncohort and trended toward better outcomes in the validation cohort. \n \na\nCell type\nState abundance\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic cells\nECs\nEpithelial-like cells\nFibroblast-like cells\nMast cells\nMono/mac\nPMNs\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nCo-occurence of cell states\nin sarcoma ecotypes \nEpi\nMac\nDC\nPMN\nEpi\nFib\nEndo\nB\nB\nCD8\nCD8\nMac\nMast\nPMN\nb\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nEpi\nEndo\nB\nCD8\nDC\nMast\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nc\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nC2\nC1\nSarcoma\necotype\nSarcoma\nimmune class\nSarcoma\necotype\nCINSARC\nsignature\nData from TCGA\nData from Chibon et al.\nEcotype\nCell type\nState\nHistology\nLPS\nMPNST\nUPS\nSS\nLMS\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nDistribution of cell-state abundances\nacross sarcoma ecotypes \nComparison of sarcoma ecotypes with\npublished gene expression signatures \nFig. 4 | Discovery of sarcoma multicellular communities. a, Heat map of cell-\nstate abundances across STSs of different histologies from the discovery cohort \nseparated into three SEs.

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d). Patients assigned \nto SE1 seemed to have an intermediate prognosis.

These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c). We observed stable to slightly increased S01 CD8+ T cell \nabundance (Fig. 8f) with a significant decrease in the S01 M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages associated with SE3 after starting \n \na\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n10\n–2\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox DMFS\nhazard ratio\nValidation (microarray)\nValidation (microarray)\nb\nc\nd\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.07\n0.08\nn = 100\nn = 37\nn = 92\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nDMFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.08\n0.04\nn = 90\nn = 44\nn = 77\nFig. 6 | Association of SEs with patient outcomes. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of \nPFS in the training cohort stratified by SE assignment.

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

For b, d, f and g, \npatients were analyzed based on ecotype abundance and all patients were \nincluded in the analysis.\nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nof the APOBEC mutagenesis-related COSMIC signature 2. Previous \nstudies have also associated APOBEC mutagenesis with increased \nimmune infiltration into tumors and improved survival in other can-\ncers52,53. The lower mutational burden and lower APOBEC mutagenesis \nin SE1 may explain the low immune infiltration into these tumors. Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review \nBoards at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Written \ninformed consent was obtained for all samples collected and all data \nincluded in this study.\nTraining cohort\nPre-processed bulk RNA-seq profiles of STSs from TCGA were down-\nloaded60 and scaled to transcripts per million (TPM). BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55).

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18. One SIC characterized by high immune infiltration \nand the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) was associ-\nated with better outcomes in patients with localized sarcomas and \nLocalized STSs\nSurvival\nShorter\nLonger\nTime\nSurvival (%)\nDeconvolution of\ncell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nIdentification of\ntranscriptional\ncell states\nDiscovery of tumor\ncellular ecosystems\n(ecotypes)\nAdvanced STSs\nChemotherapy\ncohort\nImmunotherapy\ntraining cohort\nImmunotherapy\nvalidation cohort\nn = 37\nn = 38\nn = 29\nTraining cohort\n(RNA-seq)\nValidation cohort\n(Microarray)\nn = 299 bulk sarcomas\nn = 310 bulk sarcomas\nBulk RNA-seq profiles of\nSTSs\nCell state identification\nfrom bulk gene expression\nCell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nValidation of cell states\nusing scRNA-seq\nAssociation between cell\nstates and clinical outcomes\nAssociation between ecotypes\nand clinical outcomes\nValidation of ecotypes using\nspatial transcriptomics\nCellular communities based on\nco-occurring cell states\n3 histologies\n19 tumors\n31,760 cells\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic\ncells\nEndothelial\ncells\nEpithelial-like\ncells\nFibroblast-like\ncells\nMast cells\nMonocytes and\nmacrophages\nPMNs\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nSS\nMPNST\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nOther\na\nFig. 1 | A machine-learning framework for large-scale identification and \nvalidation of sarcoma cell states and ecosystems. a, Schematic showing the \nimplementation of EcoTyper in patients with STS.

Using this \napproach, we identified two to four cell states per cell type, repre-\nsenting 23 distinct cell states (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 4). We \nthen performed reference-guided recovery of the cell states identified \nin non-LMS STSs from TCGA to estimate the abundance of each cell \nstate in the remaining sarcomas within our training and independent \nvalidation cohorts.\nTo validate the cell states identified from bulk gene expression, \nwe performed scRNA-seq on four LMSs and three UPSs from a total \nof six patients (Supplementary Table 5) and analyzed previously pub-\nlished scRNA-seq from 12 synovial sarcomas (SSs) from ten patients15 \n(Extended Data Fig. 1b). We implemented a hybrid approach, leveraging \ninferred copy-number variation and similarity of single-cell transcrip-\ntomes to bulk sarcoma gene expression to identify malignant and \nnormal cells within our scRNA-seq datasets (Extended Data Fig. 2a–d \nand Supplementary Table 6).

To explore the functions of the identified sarcoma cell states, we \ndefined marker genes for the most abundant cell states present within \nthe scRNA-seq datasets (Supplementary Table 8). Cell-state marker \ngene expression was reproducible across STS histologies profiled by \nscRNA-seq (Fig. 2b).

Patient \nsurvival, histologies and cell-state abundances used in the analysis of the training \nand validation cohorts are shown in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, respectively. \nOnly patients with available survival data were included in the analysis.\nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ntumor-associated macrophages. State 1 (S01) and S02 monocytes/\nmacrophages expressed markers previously associated with M2-like \nmacrophage polarization with distinct expression signatures between \nstates (CLEC5A and SPP1 in S01 monocytes/macrophages and ROMO1 \nand STAB1 in S02 monocytes/macrophages)23–26. In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c). Higher B cell abundance has previously been \nreported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with \nsarcomas18, and a higher abundance of CD69+ activated memory B cells \n(S01) was significantly associated with better outcomes in our training \ncohort and trended toward better outcomes in the validation cohort. \n \na\nCell type\nState abundance\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic cells\nECs\nEpithelial-like cells\nFibroblast-like cells\nMast cells\nMono/mac\nPMNs\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nCo-occurence of cell states\nin sarcoma ecotypes \nEpi\nMac\nDC\nPMN\nEpi\nFib\nEndo\nB\nB\nCD8\nCD8\nMac\nMast\nPMN\nb\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nEpi\nEndo\nB\nCD8\nDC\nMast\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nc\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nC2\nC1\nSarcoma\necotype\nSarcoma\nimmune class\nSarcoma\necotype\nCINSARC\nsignature\nData from TCGA\nData from Chibon et al.\nEcotype\nCell type\nState\nHistology\nLPS\nMPNST\nUPS\nSS\nLMS\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nDistribution of cell-state abundances\nacross sarcoma ecotypes \nComparison of sarcoma ecotypes with\npublished gene expression signatures \nFig. 4 | Discovery of sarcoma multicellular communities. a, Heat map of cell-\nstate abundances across STSs of different histologies from the discovery cohort \nseparated into three SEs.

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d).

These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c). We observed stable to slightly increased S01 CD8+ T cell \nabundance (Fig. 8f) with a significant decrease in the S01 M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages associated with SE3 after starting \n \na\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n10\n–2\n10\n–1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox DMFS\nhazard ratio\nValidation (microarray)\nValidation (microarray)\nb\nc\nd\nTraining (RNA-seq)\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.07\n0.08\nn = 100\nn = 37\nn = 92\n0\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nDMFS (%)\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.08\n0.04\nn = 90\nn = 44\nn = 77\nFig. 6 | Association of SEs with patient outcomes. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of \nPFS in the training cohort stratified by SE assignment.

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

Previous \nstudies have also associated APOBEC mutagenesis with increased \nimmune infiltration into tumors and improved survival in other can-\ncers52,53. The lower mutational burden and lower APOBEC mutagenesis \nin SE1 may explain the low immune infiltration into these tumors. Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review \nBoards at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Written \ninformed consent was obtained for all samples collected and all data \nincluded in this study.\nTraining cohort\nPre-processed bulk RNA-seq profiles of STSs from TCGA were down-\nloaded60 and scaled to transcripts per million (TPM). BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies.

A completed phase I trial\n(NCT00556881) of the anti-CTLA-4 drug ipilimumab in\nchildren and adolescents with treatment-resistant cancer\nincluded sarcomas, but no results have been reported yet. A\nsecond phase II study (NCT00140855) involving ipilimumab for\npatients with synovial sarcoma was stopped early due to poor\naccrual and no objective responses.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma. Thus, it is of great importance to\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 6 | Relationship between the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation in sarcoma and pancancer.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Here, we employed EcoTyper, \na machine-learning framework, to identify the fundamental cell states \nand cellular ecosystems that make up sarcomas on a large scale using bulk \ntranscriptomes with clinical annotations. We identified and validated  \n23 sarcoma-specific, transcriptionally defined cell states, many of which \nwere highly prognostic of patient outcomes across independent datasets. \nWe discovered three conserved cellular communities or ecotypes associated \nwith underlying genomic alterations and distinct clinical outcomes.  \nWe show that one ecotype defined by tumor-associated macrophages and \nepithelial-like malignant cells predicts response to immune-checkpoint \ninhibition but not chemotherapy and validate our findings in an \nindependent cohort.

Unfortunately, there are few effective systemic therapies for \npatients with metastatic STS, and the median survival is less than 2 \nyears3–5. Several tumor characteristics, including tumor size, grade \nand histology have been shown to be associated with risk of progres-\nsion after treatment for localized STS6,7.

A follow-up study \ndemonstrated that selecting patients with TLSs increased the response \nrate to pembrolizumab in advanced STS17; however, the presence of \nTLSs seems to be associated with favorable outcomes regardless of \ntreatment19.\nHere, we implement a machine-learning framework called \nEcoTyper20 to identify the fundamental cell states and cellular com-\nmunities that make up STSs and validate our findings with single-cell \nand spatial transcriptomics analysis. We identify 23 transcriptionally \ndefined cell states across malignant, immune and stromal cells in \nthe sarcoma microenvironment and explore their association with \npatient outcomes. Furthermore, we discover three sarcoma ecotypes \ndefined by co-occurring cell states that are associated with prognosis \nand predict response to ICI. These findings provide a high-resolution \nview of the cell states and ecosystems that determine clinical outcomes \nin human STSs.\nResults\nIdentification and validation of sarcoma cell states\nEcoTyper utilizes a machine-learning framework to extract \ncell-type-specific gene expression from bulk transcriptomes, identify \ntranscriptional cell states for each cell type and define tumor ecosys-\ntems (‘ecotypes’) made up of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 1). To imple-\nment EcoTyper for STSs, we assembled a training cohort of 299 patients \nwith localized STS profiled with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)16,21 \nand a validation cohort of 310 patients with localized STSs profiled \nby microarray8 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3).\nWe initially applied EcoTyper to 153 patients with non-LMS STSs \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify sarcoma-specific \ntranscriptional cell states. Using CIBERSORTx22, we estimated \ncell-type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles \n(GEPs) across nine cell types per sarcoma. Next, we reconstructed \nthe weighted contribution of the fundamental transcriptional states \nwithin each cell type using the EcoTyper framework for non-negative \nto predict the risk of metastasis in STS8; however, the role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with high-risk STS remains controversial9 and \nit will be important to understand additional factors that contribute \nto progression.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that immune-checkpoint inhi-\nbition (ICI) can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with \nmetastatic STS, but the majority of sarcomas fail to respond10–12. The \nclinical activity of ICI has been reported to be higher in certain STS \nhistologies such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)12; \nhowever, other histologies such as leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can also \nrespond to ICI at lower rates10. Unfortunately, traditional biomark-\ners of response to ICI, including tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 \nexpression, do not seem to identify the majority of responders in STS13.\nThe tumor microenvironment consists of complex cellular com-\nmunities that are essential for tumor development and response to \ntherapies such as ICI14. Unlike most human cancers that arise from \nepithelial tissues, sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, leading to \nunique interactions with the surrounding stroma. Due to the rarity of \nSTSs, few studies have explored the sarcoma microenvironment at the \nsingle-cell level15. Furthermore, most clinical samples are formalin fixed \nand paraffin embedded (FFPE), leading to nucleic acid crosslinking and \npreventing single-cell dissociation. As a result, standard approaches \nto study the tumor microenvironment such as flow cytometry and \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are not feasible in large, clini-\ncally annotated datasets.\nPrevious studies analyzing a limited number of cell types that \nmay not represent all of the unique cells present within mesenchymal \ntumors have suggested that the sarcoma microenvironment is prognos-\ntic and associated with treatment outcomes16–18. For example, a recent \nstudy defined five sarcoma immune classes (SICs) associated with \npatient prognosis using gene expression signatures for nine canonical \nstromal cell types18. One SIC characterized by high immune infiltration \nand the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) was associ-\nated with better outcomes in patients with localized sarcomas and \nLocalized STSs\nSurvival\nShorter\nLonger\nTime\nSurvival (%)\nDeconvolution of\ncell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nIdentification of\ntranscriptional\ncell states\nDiscovery of tumor\ncellular ecosystems\n(ecotypes)\nAdvanced STSs\nChemotherapy\ncohort\nImmunotherapy\ntraining cohort\nImmunotherapy\nvalidation cohort\nn = 37\nn = 38\nn = 29\nTraining cohort\n(RNA-seq)\nValidation cohort\n(Microarray)\nn = 299 bulk sarcomas\nn = 310 bulk sarcomas\nBulk RNA-seq profiles of\nSTSs\nCell state identification\nfrom bulk gene expression\nCell-type-specific\nexpression profiles\nValidation of cell states\nusing scRNA-seq\nAssociation between cell\nstates and clinical outcomes\nAssociation between ecotypes\nand clinical outcomes\nValidation of ecotypes using\nspatial transcriptomics\nCellular communities based on\nco-occurring cell states\n3 histologies\n19 tumors\n31,760 cells\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic\ncells\nEndothelial\ncells\nEpithelial-like\ncells\nFibroblast-like\ncells\nMast cells\nMonocytes and\nmacrophages\nPMNs\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nSS\nMPNST\nUPS\nLMS\nLPS\nOther\na\nFig. 1 | A machine-learning framework for large-scale identification and \nvalidation of sarcoma cell states and ecosystems. a, Schematic showing the \nimplementation of EcoTyper in patients with STS.

Patient \nsurvival, histologies and cell-state abundances used in the analysis of the training \nand validation cohorts are shown in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, respectively. \nOnly patients with available survival data were included in the analysis.\nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ntumor-associated macrophages. State 1 (S01) and S02 monocytes/\nmacrophages expressed markers previously associated with M2-like \nmacrophage polarization with distinct expression signatures between \nstates (CLEC5A and SPP1 in S01 monocytes/macrophages and ROMO1 \nand STAB1 in S02 monocytes/macrophages)23–26. In contrast, S03 mono-\ncytes/macrophages expressed both classical M2 polarization markers \n(MRC1 and CD163) and markers associated with M1 polarization and \npro-inflammatory responses (IRF5 and MYO1F)27–29.\nBecause sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, we were sur-\nprised to identify four epithelial-like cell states in addition to two \nmalignant fibroblast-like cell states. Epithelial-like sarcoma cells are \nknown to exist within certain sarcoma histologies such as epithelioid \nsarcoma30 and SS31, and sarcomas have been reported to undergo \nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)32. Furthermore, the \npresence of epithelial-like malignant cells was recently confirmed \nby scRNA-seq of SS where both mesenchymal and epithelial gene \nexpression modules were observed within translocation-positive \nsarcoma cells15. We explored the presence of fibroblast-like cells and \nepithelial-like cells within other sarcoma histologies in more depth. \nWe first used CIBERSORTx to estimate the abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells within the sarcomas from our training \ncohort. As expected, fibroblast-like cells were detected across all STSs \n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Notably, although detection of epithelial-like \ncells varied across samples, epithelial-like cells were present across all \nsarcoma histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Despite different mes-\nenchymal cells of origin, the combined abundance of fibroblast-like \ncells and epithelial-like cells significantly correlated with tumor \npurity across histologies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These findings \nsuggest that the fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cell states iden-\ntified using EcoTyper represent malignant sarcoma cells along the \n \nspectrum of MET.\nTo further explore the presence of epithelial-like malignant cells \nwithin STSs, we evaluated expression of epithelial markers within \nLMS and UPS tumor cells by scRNA-seq. A subset of malignant cells \nexpressed epithelial markers, including epithelial cadherin (CDH1) \nand epithelial membrane antigen (MUC1; Extended Data Fig. 4a)33. \n \nUtilizing the gene expression modules defined in SSs15 and previously \ndescribed gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT; Supplementary Table 11)34–36, we observed a spectrum \nof epithelial differentiation in both LMS and UPS STSs by scRNA-seq \n(Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, epithelial-like \ncell-state marker genes showed overlap with gene sets associated with \noncogenic pathways (KRAS in S03 epithelial cells and both MYC and \nMTORC1 in S04 epithelial cells; Supplementary Table 9). To explore \nthe expression of epithelial markers at the protein level in STSs, we per-\nformed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDH1, MUC1 and syndecan-1 \n(SDC1), a transmembrane proteoglycan expressed by normal and \nmalignant epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 12)37. At least one of \nthe epithelial markers was detected by IHC in tumor cells for 96% of \npatients with STSs (Fig. 2f,g). These results suggest that epithelial-like \nmalignant cells are present across STS histologies.\nAssociation of sarcoma cell states with patient outcomes\nWe next explored the association of the EcoTyper cell states with patient \noutcomes. On multivariable analysis incorporating histology, 12 of \nthe 23 cell states (52%) were associated with progression-free survival \n(PFS) in our training cohort (Fig. 3a). Of note, the associations between \ncell-state abundance and patient outcomes were highly conserved in \nthe validation cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5). Eight of the 12 cell states \nthat were significantly associated with patient outcomes in the train-\ning cohort were also significant in the validation cohort. Furthermore, \nthe direction of the association was preserved for most cell states, and \nwe observed a strong correlation across cohorts despite the different \nplatforms used for bulk gene expression profiling (Fig. 3b).\nConsistent with previous reports38, a higher abundance of \nCLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages (S01) was \nassociated with inferior outcomes in both our training and valida-\ntion cohorts (Fig. 3c). Higher B cell abundance has previously been \nreported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with \nsarcomas18, and a higher abundance of CD69+ activated memory B cells \n(S01) was significantly associated with better outcomes in our training \ncohort and trended toward better outcomes in the validation cohort. \n \na\nCell type\nState abundance\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nB cells\nCD8+ T cells\nDendritic cells\nECs\nEpithelial-like cells\nFibroblast-like cells\nMast cells\nMono/mac\nPMNs\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nCo-occurence of cell states\nin sarcoma ecotypes \nEpi\nMac\nDC\nPMN\nEpi\nFib\nEndo\nB\nB\nCD8\nCD8\nMac\nMast\nPMN\nb\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nEpi\nEndo\nB\nCD8\nDC\nMast\nState\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nc\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nC2\nC1\nSarcoma\necotype\nSarcoma\nimmune class\nSarcoma\necotype\nCINSARC\nsignature\nData from TCGA\nData from Chibon et al.\nEcotype\nCell type\nState\nHistology\nLPS\nMPNST\nUPS\nSS\nLMS\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\nDistribution of cell-state abundances\nacross sarcoma ecotypes \nComparison of sarcoma ecotypes with\npublished gene expression signatures \nFig. 4 | Discovery of sarcoma multicellular communities. a, Heat map of cell-\nstate abundances across STSs of different histologies from the discovery cohort \nseparated into three SEs.

For exam-\nple, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like endothelial cells (S02) were \nassociated with improved outcomes in both cohorts across sarcoma \nhistologies (Fig. 3d). In addition, epithelial-like malignant cells with \nupregulated MYC/MTORC signaling (S04) were associated with poor \noutcomes, and both epithelial-like (S03) and fibroblast-like (S01) malig-\nnant cells with activation of the KRAS pathway were associated with \nfavorable outcomes. These results demonstrate that transcriptionally \ndefined malignant and normal cell states are consistently associated \nwith patient prognosis in STS.\nReconstructing STS cellular communities\nWe next explored the patterns of cell-state co-occurrence using the \nEcoTyper framework to reconstruct the fundamental cellular com-\nmunities within STSs. We discovered three distinct ‘sarcoma ecotypes’ \n(SEs) made up of four to ten co-occurring cell states per community \n(Fig. 4a,b). Although most STSs could be assigned to a dominant SE, \nwe observed evidence of multiple sarcoma ecotypes within each \nsample. As a result, we also estimated the abundance of the three SEs \nwithin each sample in a continuous manner. SE1 was characterized \nby several immune cell states lacking activation markers and SALL1+ \npro-angiogenic endothelial cells (S01). In contrast, SE2 consisted of sev-\neral activated immune cell states, NOSTRIN/PECAM1/CD36+ normal-like \nendothelial cells (S02) and malignant cells with activation of the KRAS \npathway. Finally, SE3 was characterized by MYC/MTORC1 activated \nepithelial-like malignant cells (S04) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immu-\nnosuppressive macrophages (S01). Notably, SEs were distinct from \npreviously described STS prognostic gene expression signatures \n \n(Fig. 4c)8,18, suggesting that the EcoTyper framework enables additional \ninsights into sarcoma biology.\nTo further characterize the three SEs, we explored their clinical, \ncellular and molecular characteristics (Fig. 5a and Supplementary \nTable 13). SE1 was enriched in female patients and patients with \nSS. SE1 sarcomas were immune cold with a low abundance of most \nimmune cell subsets and elevated Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, \nSE2 sarcomas were more consistent with classically immune-hot \ntumors with a high abundance of B and CD8+ T cells and enriched \ninterferon-α and -γ signaling39. SE2 was enriched in male patients \nand patients with liposarcomas. Finally, SE3 was enriched in older \npatients and in UPSs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors \n(MPNSTs) compared to other histologies. SE3 tumors were charac-\nterized by intermediate immune infiltration and elevated MYC and \nMTORC1 signaling.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the tumor microenviron-\nment can change over time and in response to therapy40,41, which could \ncomplicate the implementation of SEs as biomarkers in STSs. To explore \nwhether SEs change over time, we compared ecotype abundance across \ntime points in patients with more than one sarcoma sample available \nfor analysis. Among these 24 patients, 71% underwent treatment with \nsystemic therapy between sampling and 45% of paired samples were \nfrom primary tumors and a separate location of metastatic disease \n(Supplementary Table 14). Of note, SE abundance was highly correlated \nacross different time points despite a median of 14 months elapsing \nbetween samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\nTo explore the possibility that genomic alterations may \nunderly the tumor microenvironment within STS, we compared the \nsingle-nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels and copy-number altera-\ntions (CNAs) across SEs from TCGA (Fig. 5b). We observed significantly \nmore CNAs and SNVs/indels in SE3 compared to other SEs (Fig. 5c and \nExtended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting genomic instability may play a \nrole in shaping the microenvironment in these tumors. Several genes \nwere more frequently altered by SNVs/indels or CNAs in SE3 sarcomas \ncompared to other SEs (Supplementary Table 15). Consistent with the \nhallmark gene set analysis for S04 epithelial-like cells and bulk SE3 \ntumors, amplifications of MYC and MTOR were significantly enriched \nin SE3 sarcomas. We also observed a significantly increased contribu-\ntion of the COSMIC mutational signature 2 in SE2 sarcomas (Fig. 5d and \nExtended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis \nin these tumors16,42. These findings suggest that underlying genomic \nalterations within malignant cells may drive sarcoma ecosystems, \nwhich could explain the consistency of SEs across different samples \nfrom the same patient.\nTo investigate the colocalization and interaction of cell states \nwith human sarcomas, we profiled four STSs using spatial transcrip-\ntomics (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We performed reference-guided \nrecovery to estimate the abundance of each cell state and SE within \neach spatially barcoded spot. In addition to co-occurring within the \nsame tumors, cell states within the same ecotype tended to occur \nwithin the same regions of sarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell \nstates within the same SE had a stronger spatial correlation than cell \nstates from different ecotypes (Fig. 5e). Notably, SEs tended to be \naggregated within spatially distinct regions of the tumor (Fig. 5f and \nExtended Data Fig. 7c). Across the four sarcomas profiled by spatial \ntranscriptomics, all ecotypes were significantly spatially aggregated \n(Fig. 5g), suggesting that SEs represent distinct functional units within \nhuman sarcomas.\nWe next explored intercellular signaling networks within SEs by \nidentifying putative ligand–receptor pairs across cell states (Supple-\nmentary Table 16). We observed complex cell–cell interactions between \ncell states within the same ecotype (Fig. 5h). TNFA/KRAS-activated \nfibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed multiple ligands with corre-\nsponding receptors on other cell states within SE2. For example, TNFA/\nKRAS-activated fibroblast-like cells (S01) overexpressed TNFSF13 and \nTNFSF18 whose receptors TNFRSF17 and TNFRSF18 were overexpressed \non CD69+ activated memory B cells (S01) and GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ \nexhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01), respectively. Similarly, TRIM29+ \nepithelial-like cells (S01) and CLEC5A/SPP1+ M2-like immunosuppressive \nmacrophages (S01) seemed to be at the center of the signaling networks \nfor SE1 and SE3, respectively. These results highlight potential cellular \ninteractions that could shape the STS microenvironment.\nFig. 5 | Characterization of SEs. a, Plot of SE biological features in the training \ncohort.

In addition, we analyzed SE abundance as a \ncontinuous variable while accounting for sarcoma histology using \nCox multivariable analysis. In both training and validation cohorts, we \nobserved that patients assigned to SE2 had superior outcomes than the \nother SEs (Fig. 6a,c). On multivariable analysis, including histology, \npatients with higher SE2 abundance continued to have significantly \nbetter outcomes, and patients with higher SE3 abundance had signifi-\ncantly worse outcomes in both cohorts (Fig. 6b,d). Patients assigned \nto SE1 seemed to have an intermediate prognosis.

These results suggest \nthat SEs are associated with prognosis in localized STSs.\nPrediction of ICI response using SEs\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the response of \nsolid tumors to systemic therapies such as ICI44. As a result, we con-\nstructed two cohorts of patients with advanced sarcoma who received \nsystemic therapy with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(n = 37) or a combination of immune-checkpoint blockade with ipili-\nmumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) \n(n = 38; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 18–20). We \nassessed the association of SE assignment and SE abundance with \noutcomes in both cohorts as described above. Similar to our cohorts \nof patients with localized sarcoma, patients in SE2 and patients with a \nhigher SE2 abundance had significantly better outcomes after chemo-\ntherapy (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, we observed that patients in SE3, who \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes in patients with localized \nsarcoma and in our chemotherapy cohort, had the best PFS after ICI \n \n(Fig. 7c). In addition, higher SE3 abundance was associated with better \nPFS after ICI on multivariable analysis, including histology (Fig. 7d). \n \nThese findings suggest that SE3 represents a candidate predictive bio-\nmarker for response to ICI in patients with advanced sarcoma.\nTo further explore the potential for SE3 to identify patients with \nSTSs who benefit from ICI, we analyzed treatment response by SE. \nTwo of the three responders assigned to SEs in our ICI cohort were \nassigned to SE3 (Fig. 7e). SE3 abundance was significantly higher \namong responders than nonresponders (Fig. 7f) and among patients \nachieving 6 months of nonprogression after starting ICI (Extended \nData Fig. 9a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance outperformed previously \nreported predictors of ICI response in sarcomas, TLS and PD-L1 expres-\nsion, for predicting both response and 6-month nonprogression \n \n(Fig. 7g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We observed higher PD-L1 expres-\nsion and more frequent TLSs in STSs assigned to SE2 compared to SE1 \n(Extended Data Fig. 9c,d); however, elevated PD-L1 expression and the \npresence of TLSs were both detected among patients assigned to SE3. \nNotably, SE3 abundance did not predict response to chemotherapy \n(Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). These findings illustrate the promise for \nSE3 abundance to select patients with STS who would benefit from ICI \nbut not chemotherapy.\nValidation of ICI response prediction\nTo validate the ability of SE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in \nSTSs, we analyzed an independent cohort of 29 patients treated on \nthree clinical trials evaluating combinations of anti-PD-1 antibodies \nwith experimental immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Sup-\nplementary Table 21)45–47. Of the four responders in the ICI validation \ncohort assigned to sarcoma ecotypes, three patients were assigned to \nSE3 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, SE3 abundance was significantly higher in \nresponders than nonresponders (Fig. 8b) and strongly predicted ICI \nresponse (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; Extended Data Fig. 10a). \nTo further determine whether SE3 abundance can be used to enrich \nfor patients likely to respond to ICI, we defined the optimal cutoff for \nSE3 abundance in the training cohort (0.305) and applied the same \ncutoff to the validation cohort. Overall, 28.5% of patients in the train-\ning cohort and 42.9% of patients in the validation cohort above the \nthreshold responded to ICI, whereas no patients below the threshold \nresponded in either cohort (Fig. 8c). We also explored the ability of \nSE3 abundance to predict response to ICI in patients with metastatic \nurothelial bladder carcinoma and melanoma, but we did not observe \na significant association in these cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10b and \nSupplementary Table 22). These results validate the ability of SE3 abun-\ndance to predict response to ICI in STSs across independent cohorts.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated mac-\nrophages can activate the adaptive immune system and directly kill \ntumor cells in response to ICI in other solid tumors48,49; however, ICI is \ntraditionally thought to enable antitumor responses through activa-\ntion of CD8+ T cells50. We examined our spatial transcriptomics data \nto explore the possibility that CD8+ T cell populations not assigned to \nSE3 could play a role in ICI response within sarcomas. Among the CD8+ \nT cell states identified by EcoTyper, GRZMA/PDCD1/TIGIT+ exhausted \ncytotoxic CD8+ T cells (S01) were in the closest proximity to SE3 spots \n(Fig. 8d). Notably, although S01 CD8+ T cells were assigned to SE2 by \nco-occurrence in bulk tumors, they had similar proximity to SE3 spots \nby spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 8e). To further evaluate the role of sar-\ncoma cell states in ICI response, we compared cell state and ecotype \nabundance pre-treatment and on-treatment in 19 patients from the \n \nICI validation cohort with paired samples available (Extended Data \nFig. 10c).

These results suggest that ICI reduces the abundance of \nS01 M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, which may enable S01 \nCD8+ T cells to generate antitumor immune responses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we implemented a machine-learning framework to decode \nthe fundamental cell states and cellular communities that exist within \nSTSs. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated broadly \ndefined cell types and states identified in other cancers16,18, our com-\nputational approach enabled the identification of cell states that are \nspecific to STSs. We observed a strong association of both individual \ncell states and SEs with patient outcomes across independent data-\nsets, confirming the importance of the sarcoma microenvironment \nin tumor progression and response to treatment. Finally, we demon-\nstrated that SE3 abundance is a candidate predictive biomarker for \nidentifying patients with advanced STSs who benefit from ICI but not \nchemotherapy.\nEcoTyper overcomes the limitations of most clinical specimens \nand avoids the need for physical dissociation, which is known to affect \ngene expression and the representation of certain cell populations51. \nWe were able to validate most cell states identified by EcoTyper using \nscRNA-seq with the remaining cell states poorly represented in our \nscRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed the colocalization of \nthe cell states within SEs using spatial transcriptomics, demonstrating \nthe potential for cellular interactions that may affect sarcoma biol-\nogy. SEs were distinct from SICs18 and CINSARC groups8, which have \nboth been previously associated with patient prognosis. In contrast to \nSICs that were defined based on tumor immune infiltration alone and \nCINSARC groups based on genes associated with genomic complexity \nwithin malignant cells, SEs were defined based on the colocalization \nof transcriptionally defined states across malignant and stromal cells.\nAlthough SEs aggregated within distinct regions of the tumor, \necotype abundance was highly correlated across sarcoma samples. \nTherefore, profiling a limited number of tissue cores or slides seems \nto be sufficient to characterize the general ecotype composition of \na patient’s sarcoma. Notably, SEs were associated with underlying \ngenomic alterations, with SE3 sarcomas having a higher abundance of \nSNVs/indels and CNAs and SE2 sarcomas having a higher contribution \ne\na\nb\nc\nd\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n* Progression of non-target lesions\nf\n10\n–4\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n*\n10\n–2\n10\n0\n10\n2\nSE3\nSE2\nSE1\nMultivariable Cox PFS\nhazard ratio\nChemotherapy\n0\n12\n24\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMonths\nPFS (%)\nChemotherapy\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.04\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nIpilimumab/nivolumab\nP = 0.01\ng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n100 – specificity (%)\nSensitivity (%)\nIpilimumab/nivolumab response\nPD-L1\nTLS\nSE3\nAUC (95% CI)\n0.87 (0.73–1.00)\n0.81 (0.60–1.00)\n0.62 (0.31–0.93)\nn = 9\nn = 4\nn = 11\nn = 14\nn = 4\nn = 10\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 7 | Predicting STS response to ICI with SEs. a, Kaplan–Meier plot of PFS \nin patients with advanced STSs treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy \nstratified by SE assignment.

Previous \nstudies have also associated APOBEC mutagenesis with increased \nimmune infiltration into tumors and improved survival in other can-\ncers52,53. The lower mutational burden and lower APOBEC mutagenesis \nin SE1 may explain the low immune infiltration into these tumors. Due \nto the strong association of SEs with patient prognosis and their abil-\nity to predict response to ICI, our findings could enable personalized \ntreatment in patients with STSs; however, it will be important to validate \nthese findings in additional retrospective and prospective cohorts. \nAlthough RNA-seq is increasingly used for STSs to detect gene fusions54, \nwe are also exploring surrogate markers of SEs.\nBecause the majority of patients do not respond to ICI10,12, bio-\nmarkers will be crucial to unlock the potential of ICI in sarcomas. PD-L1 \nexpression has been associated with response to ICI in sarcomas13, and \nthe phase II PEMBROSARC trial demonstrated improved 6-month non-\nprogression rates and objective response rates in STSs selected based \non the presence of TLSs17. In our study, SE3 abundance outperformed \nboth biomarkers for predicting ICI response and 6-month nonprogres-\nsion. Furthermore, we were able to validate the ability of SE3 abundance \nto predict ICI response in an independent cohort treated with different \nimmunotherapies in combination with ICI. In contrast to SICs and the \npresence of TLSs, which are prognostic of favorable outcomes in both \npatients with early-stage disease and after treatment with ICI18, we dem-\nonstrated that SE3 predicted favorable outcomes after treatment with \nICI but not chemotherapy or in localized STSs. As a result, measuring \nSE3 abundance may represent a powerful approach to identify patients \nwith advanced sarcoma who should be treated with ICI. Although a \nhigher SE2 abundance was associated with significantly better PFS after \nchemotherapy, no SEs predicted chemotherapy objective response. \nTherefore, additional factors outside of the STS microenvironment \nmay also contribute to chemotherapy response.\nThe proportion of patients assigned to SE3 was highest in UPS, \nwhich may explain the high clinical activity of ICI in this histology12. \nWe also observed a high SE3 abundance in ICI responders with MPNSTs \na\nd\ne\nf\nHigh Low\nHigh Low\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSE3 abundance\nPercent of patients\nResponder\nNonresponder\nTraining\nValidation\nb\nc\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nState abundance\nS01 mono/mac\nP = 0.0006\nPre-Tx\nOn-Tx\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nState abundance\nS01 CD8+ T cells\nP = 0.33\ng\nYes\nNo\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nResponse\nSE3 abundance\nImmunotherapy validation\nP = 0.002\nS01\nS02\nS03\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCD8+ T cell state\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nSE3\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\nEcotype\nMean distance\nfrom cells\nS01 CD8+ T cells\n15\n8\n6\n24\n10\n4\n–100\n–50\n0\n50\n100\n–30\n20\nChange from baseline (%)\nImmunotherapy validation\n* Progression of non-target lesions\n* *\nSE1\nSE2\nSE3\n0.01\n0.006\n1.4 × 10\n–7\n6.9 × 10\n–17\n9.9 × 10\n–44\n3.4 × 10\n–42\n1.0 × 10\n–40\nFig. 8 | Validation of SE3 as a predictor of response to ICI in STSs. a, Waterfall \nplot showing the best response by RECIST criteria measured by percentage \nchange in the sum of target lesion diameters for patients with advanced STSs \nin the ICI validation cohort based on SE assignment.

Although sarcomas have a lower tumor mutational burden \nthan most epithelial tumors16, SE3 sarcomas had more SNVs/indels \nand CNAs than SE2 and SE1 sarcomas. Notably, SE3 sarcomas did not \ndisplay the immune-hot phenotype observed in many epithelial tumors \nthat respond favorably to ICI39. Instead, SE3 sarcomas consisted of an \nintermediate level of immune infiltration characterized by M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages (S01), MYC/MTORC1-activated \nepithelial-like cells (S04), mature dendritic cells (S01) and \npro-inflammatory neutrophils (S02). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been \nshown to increase macrophage phagocytosis49 and tumor-associated \nmacrophages may also inhibit the antitumor immune responses by \nCD8+ T cells55. Although a CD8+ T cell population was not assigned to \nSE3 in bulk tumors, we observed strong evidence of colocalization \nbetween SE3 and an exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell state (S01) by spa-\ntial transcriptomics. Of note, SE3 abundance did not predict response \nto ICI in bladder cancer or melanoma, suggesting a distinct mechanism \nof ICI response in sarcomas. Together, our findings support a model \nwhere SE3 sarcomas are primed for antitumor immune responses with \na higher mutational load and nearby antigen-presenting dendritic cells \nand tumor-responsive CD8+ T cells; however, the presence of M2-like \nimmunosuppressive macrophages prevents tumor rejection in the \nabsence of ICI. Future mechanistic experiments in preclinical models \nwill be helpful to explore these cellular interactions and design thera-\npies that increase the number of patients with STSs who respond to ICI.\nEpithelioid sarcomas and biphasic SSs are known to express epi-\nthelial markers30,31. Although the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells has not been explored in depth in other STSs, previous stud-\nies have observed expression of epithelial markers by IHC56,57. Here, \nwe demonstrated that malignant sarcoma cells within LMS and UPS \nexpress epithelial markers by scRNA-seq. Furthermore, by using previ-\nously described gene expression signatures of EMT, we demonstrated \na spectrum of epithelial differentiation across STS histologies. Finally, \nwe confirmed expression of epithelial markers by IHC across a broad \npanel of STS histologies. MET plays a critical role in carcinoma disease \nprogression and metastasis58. In addition, EMT may promote resist-\nance to ICI59, suggesting that the presence of epithelial-like sarcoma \ncells may contribute to CD8+ T cell recognition. As a result, further \ninvestigation into the role of MET in sarcoma biology and response to \ntherapies such as ICI is warranted.\nOur sample size was limited by the rarity of STSs and relative lack \nof publicly available, clinically annotated gene expression data when \ncompared to other cancer histologies. As a result, we included diverse \nsarcoma histologies in our cohorts. We focused on non-LMS STSs pro-\nfiled by TCGA for our initial cell state and ecotype discovery to minimize \nbatch effects and improve the accuracy of our deconvolution results. \nIn the future, additional approaches to account for technical variation \nbetween samples and across platforms may enable identification of \ncell states and ecotypes in larger cohorts of STSs. Because sarcoma \nhistology is known to affect prognosis and response to therapy12, we \naccounted for histology in our multivariable models. Here we focused \non the most common STS histologies43, and future studies will be neces-\nsary to determine whether SEs are associated with patient outcomes in \nother sarcoma subtypes. Although we confirmed our findings across \nmultiple retrospective cohorts, future prospective and interventional \nstudies will be necessary before SEs can be utilized as a biomarker to \nguide clinical management. We aimed to identify cell states and cellular \ncommunities conserved across STS histologies, but there are likely \nadditional malignant and nonmalignant cell populations that may \nbe less common or specific to one or a few sarcoma histologies. For \nexample, there may be malignant cell states specific to the cell of origin \nfor different STSs. Additional studies utilizing single-cell approaches \nwill be helpful to identify these cell populations, which may contribute \nto the diversity and biology of STSs.\nIn summary, we have defined the landscape of fundamental tran-\nscriptional cell states and cellular ecosystems within STSs. Our findings \nhave confirmed a crucial role for the tumor microenvironment in \nsarcoma progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, we have \nidentified a candidate predictive biomarker of response to ICI in STSs \nthat could enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with \nadvanced disease if validated in future prospective studies.\nMethods\nHuman participants\nAll research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review \nBoards at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Written \ninformed consent was obtained for all samples collected and all data \nincluded in this study.\nTraining cohort\nPre-processed bulk RNA-seq profiles of STSs from TCGA were down-\nloaded60 and scaled to transcripts per million (TPM). BAM files from the \nSteele et al. Cancer Cell 2019 UPS dataset21 were downloaded from the \nEuropean Genome–Phenome Archive (dataset ID EGAD00001004439) \nand converted to FASTQ files. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned to Gen-\ncode v.27 transcript models, and expression levels were summarized \nusing Salmon61. After restricting to protein-coding genes, expression \nlevels per gene were summarized as TPM. Although the EcoTyper \nframework can be utilized to robustly recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross gene expression platforms and datasets20, de novo discovery \nof cell states and ecotypes performs most robustly using samples \nwith minimal batch effects. Consistent with the initial publication \nfrom TCGA, we observed that LMS clustered separately from other \nSTSs by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) \nand t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis16. \nWhen we included LMS in our initial cell state and ecotype discovery, \nwe observed expression of myogenic markers in many immune cell \nstates and were unable to validate the identified cell states, suggesting \ninaccurate deconvolution. To enable identification of cell states and \necotypes from a more homogenous cohort of patients profiled with \nthe same sequencing platform, we performed cell state and ecotype \ndiscovery on UPS, liposarcomas, SSs and MPNSTs profiled by TCGA. \nWe then separately recovered the identified cell states and ecotypes \nfrom the LMS profiled by TCGA and the UPS from the Steele et al. Can-\ncer Cell 2019 dataset21 to complete our training cohort for correlation \nwith patient outcomes. Author-provided tumor purity and clinical \ninformation were used for analysis. SIC labels for the TCGA sarcomas \nwere provided by the authors18.\nValidation cohort\nMicroarray data from the Chibon et al. dataset8 were downloaded \nfrom the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession code GSE21050). \nMicroarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm from \nthe ‘affy’ R package62, mapped to NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using \nBrainarray v.21.0, converted to HUGO gene symbols and restricted \nto protein-coding genes for input to cell state and ecotype recovery. \nPFS was not available for this cohort, so distant metastasis-free sur-\nvival (DMFS) was analyzed as a similar end point because metastases \nrepresent the majority of progression events in localized sarcomas2.\nStanford chemotherapy and ICI cohorts\nPatients with advanced STS treated with standard-of-care cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and/or combination immune-checkpoint blockade \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab were identified retrospectively from \nan institutional database. Only patients with histologies profiled by \nTCGA (UPS, liposarcomas, SSs, MPNSTs and LMS) were included in the \nanalysis. Patients with a diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic \nsarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosar-\ncoma or myxofibrosarcoma were also included and analyzed as UPS \ndue to the broad definition of this diagnosis and to be consistent with \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nthe external cohorts63. A subset of patients treated with ICI received \ncryotherapy to one lesion in between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of ICI as part \nof a phase II clinical trial (NCT04118166)64. For these patients, response \nwas assessed on lesions not treated with cryotherapy.\nBulk RNA-seq\nFFPE tumor blocks from patients in the Stanford chemotherapy and \nICI cohorts were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E) for pathology review and to identify regions with the highest \nsarcoma content for sampling. Bulk RNA was isolated from 2–3 1-mm \ncores per sample using RNAstorm FFPE RNA Extraction kits (Cell Data \nSciences). Sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded \nTotal RNA-Seq v2-Pico Input Mammalian kits (Takara Bio). Libraries \nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 or a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with \n150-bp paired-end reads. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned using Salmon \nand expression levels were summarized as TPM as described above. \nSamples with fewer than 1 million mapped reads were excluded from \nfurther analysis. For a subset of patients, two separate blocks were \nsequenced from the same time point. For these time points, mean \ncell-state abundances across both regions were used for analysis and \necotype recovery as described below. For patients with multiple time \npoints available, the sample collected closest to the start of therapy \nwas used for analysis.\nICI validation cohort\nThe ICI validation cohort consisted of patients with metastatic or locally \nadvanced STSs treated as part of three prospective clinical trials combin-\ning pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec (NCT03069378)47, \nnivolumab and bempegaldesleukin (NCT03282344)45, and pembroli-\nzumab and epacadostat (NCT03414229)46. We restricted our analysis \nto patients with histologies profiled by TCGA as described above. RNA \nwas extracted from frozen tissues, library prepped using the TruSeq \nStranded mRNA LT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 \n(Illumina) as described previously45. FASTQ files were quasi-aligned \nusing Salmon as described above and counts were batch-corrected \nusing ComBat-seq from the ‘sva’ R package to account for variation \nacross sequencing lanes65. After restricting to protein-coding genes, \nexpression levels per gene were summarized as TPM.\nBladder and melanoma ICI cohorts\nClinical annotations and raw bulk transcriptome counts from patients \nwith metastatic urothelial bladder cancer treated with atezolizumab \non the IMvigor210 phase II clinical trial were obtained via the ‘Imvig-\nor210CoreBiologies’ R package66. Clinical annotations and normal-\nized count data for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with \nanti-PD-1 antibodies41,67 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies68,69 were downloaded \nfrom the supplementary material of the published manuscripts. Expres-\nsion levels per gene were summarized as TPM for downstream analysis.\nDiscovery of sarcoma-specific cell states\nWe applied EcoTyper to identify sarcoma-specific transcriptionally \ndefined cell states from the bulk RNA-seq of non-LMS TCGA samples \nin the training cohort20. We first estimated cell-type proportions and \nimputed cell-type-specific GEPs using CIBERSORTx22. We utilized \ntwo previously validated signature matrices to analyze the major cell \npopulations within sarcomas. LM22 is a signature matrix consisting of \n22 human immune cell subsets derived from Affymetrix microarray \ndata70 and TR4 is a signature matrix consisting of epithelial, fibroblast, \nendothelial and immune populations derived from bulk RNA-seq of \nflow-sorted cell populations22. CIBERSORTx was run to impute the frac-\ntional abundance of each cell type using B-mode batch correction with \nLM22 to overcome cross-platform variation and no batch correction \nstep for TR4. The LM22 subsets were pooled into nine major lineages: B \ncells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, mono-\ncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and polymorphonuclear \ncells20. To unify the signature matrices, the immune cell fractions from \nLM22 were rescaled to sum to 1 within each sample and multiplied by \nthe total immune cell fraction from TR4, yielding fractions for a total of \n12 cell types. We then provided the cell fractions and TPM-normalized \nexpression matrix as input to the high-resolution gene expression \npurification module of CIBERSORTx. Three cell types with fewer than \n50 imputed genes were excluded from additional analysis (plasma cells, \nCD4+ T cells and natural killer cells).\nNMF combined with specialized heuristics was used to iden-\ntify and quantitate transcriptionally defined cell states within the \ncell-type-specific GEPs purified by CIBERSORTx20. For each cell- \ntype-specific imputed expression matrix, genes were log2-transformed \nand scaled to unit variance. Posneg transformation was performed to \nsatisfy the non-negativity requirement of NMF and NMF was applied to \neach transformed matrix for 2–20 clusters (cell states) using Kullback– \nLeibler divergence minimization71. To determine the number of cell \nstates for each cell type, we applied a heuristic approach based on \nclassification stability measured using the cophenetic coefficient71. For \neach cell type, the number of cell states was selected by determining \nthe last occurrence in the interval of 2–20 for which the cophenetic \ncoefficient dropped below 0.98. The number of cell states immediately \nadjacent to this crossing point with a cophenetic coefficient closest \nto 0.98 was selected. Low-quality cell states with <10 marker genes \nwere removed. In addition, an adaptive false positive index was imple-\nmented to remove spurious cell states driven by negative features as a \nresult of posneg transformation before NMF20. In total, 23 distinct cell \nstates with 2–4 cell states per cell type were identified and included in \ndownstream analysis.\nDiscovery of SEs\nWe implemented EcoTyper to identify conserved cellular commu-\nnities, termed ecotypes, defined by co-occurring cell states across \nsarcoma samples20. Each sample was assigned to the most abundant \ncell state per cell type, and a binary matrix with cell states as rows \nand samples as columns was constructed. A Jaccard index matrix was \ncalculated for all pairwise combinations of cell states, and a hyper-\ngeometric test was run to test the hypothesis of no overlap. The Jac-\ncard indices for cell-state pairs for which the null hypothesis could \nnot be rejected was set to 0, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster-\ning was applied to the Jaccard index matrix. The optimal number of \nclusters was determined by silhouette width maximization and clus-\nters with ≤2 cell states were removed from further analysis. Using \nthis approach, we identified three clusters that were termed SEs. To \nestimate the abundance of each SE, the cell-state abundance within \neach of the three ecotypes was averaged. The resulting values were \nnormalized to sum to 1 across all SEs in each sample, providing a con-\ntinuous abundance for each SE. To assign samples to SEs, a two-sided \nt-test with unequal variance was applied to evaluate the difference in \nestimated abundance between the cell states in each SE relative to the \nabundance of all cell states in other SEs. The resulting P values were \ncorrected for multiple-hypothesis testing. Samples were assigned \nto the SE with the highest abundance if the q value was ≤0.25 and the \nsample was assigned to at least one cell state within the SE. Network \nplots representing each SE were constructed using the ‘igraph’ R pack-\nage with edge weights proportional to the Jaccard index between \n \ncell states.\nRecovery of sarcoma-specific cell states and ecotypes from \nindependent datasets\nWe utilized the EcoTyper reference-guided annotation framework \nto recover and quantitate the cell states and SEs identified from the \nnon-LMS TCGA samples in other gene expression datasets20. Briefly, \nEcoTyper utilizes the learnt NMF model to determine a coefficient \nmatrix for each cell type with each cell state represented as a weight. \nThe EcoTyper recovery module was applied separately to each dataset \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\n(Supplementary Table 1), and each gene was log2-transformed and \nscaled to unit variance before analysis. We have previously vali-\ndated the ability of EcoTyper to recover cell states and ecotypes \nacross different bulk (RNA-seq and microarray) and single-cell gene \n \nexpression platforms20.\nUMAP visualization of sarcoma EcoTyper cell states\nTo generate the UMAP plots displayed in Fig. 2a, we analyzed the CIBER-\nSORTx digitally purified GEPs for canonical cell types from each sample \nin the training cohort. Samples were assigned to the most abundant cell \nstate and included in the analysis if the cell-state abundance was ≥33% \nand the most abundant cell-state abundance was ≥15% more prevalent \nthan the next most abundant cell state. The digitally purified GEPs were \nlog2-transformed and scaled to unit variance within each dataset before \ndimensionality reduction.\nPublished scRNA-seq datasets\nPreviously published SS 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 scRNA-seq \ndata from Jerby-Arnon et al.15 were downloaded from GEO under acces-\nsion code GSE131309. Author-provided cell type annotations were used \nfor cell-state recovery, and epithelial-like and fibroblast-like malignant \ncells were identified using the epithelial and mesenchymal modules \nas described below.\nscRNA-seq\nFresh tumors were minced and enzymatically dissociated using the \nHuman Tumor Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) using a GentleMACS \nOcto Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The dissociated cell suspension was then applied \nto a 70-μm MACS SmartStrainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec). The \nquality of the suspension was checked by generating an H&E smear \nand analyzed using a TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Samples \nwere further processed by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource \nusing the Chromium 3′ Gene Expression Solution v.3.1 (10x Genomics) \nas per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq \n6000 (Illumina).\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data\nFor the scRNA-seq samples new to this work, sample demultiplexing, \nread alignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and genera-\ntion of feature-barcode matrices were performed using CellRanger \nv.6.0.0 (10x Genomics). Feature-barcode matrices were analyzed using \nSeurat72. Cells with ≥15% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and \n≤200 or ≥9,000 expressed genes were excluded from the analysis. \nData were normalized and scaled before principal-component analysis \nusing the top 2,000 variable genes by default. The k-nearest neighbors \nwere calculated and a shared nearest-neighbor graph was constructed \nusing the top 25 principal components (PCs) based on the jackstraw \nprocedure. Finally, clusters were identified with a resolution of 1. \n \nWe observed similar results when choosing different numbers of PCs \nand resolutions.\nIdentification of malignant and normal single cells\nMalignant and normal single cells were identified separately for each \ntumor sample. First, the scRNA-seq profile of each cell was compared \nto bulk RNA-seq of the same sarcoma histology from TCGA and \nnormal cells from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics scRNA-seq \ndataset. For each cell, the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profiles for each normal \ncell was subtracted from the average Spearman correlation between \nits expression profile and the expression profile from bulk sarco-\nmas. For bulk sarcomas, only genes in the top and bottom deciles \nof expression were included in the analysis. Cells with a higher dif-\nferential similarity to bulk sarcomas were considered more likely to \nbe malignant15. Second, CNAs were inferred from the scRNA-seq data \nusing the ‘inferCNV’ R package73 with a cutoff of 0.05; HMM = TRUE; \ntumor_subcluster_partition_method = ‘qnorm’; k_obs_groups = 2; and \notherwise default parameters. For SRC171, better overlap with the dif-\nferential similarity to bulk tumors was observed when observations \nwere split into three groups, so the k_obs_groups was set to 3 for this \nsample. Macrophages, endothelial cells and cancer-associated fibro-\nblasts from the Jerby-Arnon et al.15 10x Genomics dataset were used \nas the normal reference. The presence of CNAs and similarity to bulk \nsarcoma transcriptomes for each cell was imported into Seurat and \nvisualized using t-SNE. Clusters were assigned as normal or malignant \ncells based on both metrics.\nNormal cell analysis\nNormal single cells from sarcomas of the same histology were com-\nbined and integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integrate-\nData functions in Seurat. The integrated data were scaled, variable \nfeatures were identified, principal-component analysis was performed \nand clusters were identified as described above. Marker genes for each \ncluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function with min.\npct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and only.pos = TRUE. Clusters were \nassigned to cell types based on canonical and previously described \nmarkers (Supplementary Table 6).\nMalignant cell analysis\nMalignant sarcoma cells from different patients were expected to \ncluster separately due to underlying genomic alterations, so data \nintegration was not performed before the malignant cell analysis. \nThe expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcomas cells \nwas visualized using the FeaturePlot function in Seurat. Epithelial \nversus mesenchymal differentiation within malignant cells was que-\nried using the AddModuleScore function to calculate the average \nexpression levels of two gene sets defined previously by Jerby-Arnon \net al. from epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like malignant SS cell \npopulations15. To generate a score of epithelial versus mesenchymal \ndifferentiation, the mesenchymal module score was subtracted from \nthe epithelial module score. Malignant cells with an epithelial versus \nmesenchymal differentiation score >0 were assigned to epithelial-like \ncells and cells with an epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation \nscore ≤0 were assigned to fibroblast-like cells. We also explored the \nspectrum of epithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation in malig-\nnant sarcoma cells using three signatures of EMT34–36. The degree of \nepithelial versus mesenchymal differentiation for each EMT signature \nwas calculated by subtracting the EMT up score from the EMT down \nscore. Because there is not a hallmark gene set for genes downregu-\nlated during EMT, the hallmark EMT score was subtracted from 0 to \nbe consistent with the other analyses. All gene sets are displayed in \n \nSupplementary Table 11.\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states from scRNA-seq\nAnnotated single-cell transcriptomes were mapped to EcoTyper states \nas described above. The statistical significance of cell-state recovery \nwas evaluated via permutation testing to produce a z score measur-\ning statistical confidence20. Only the cell states identified within each \nscRNA-seq dataset were evaluated and the resulting z scores were \ncombined into a meta z score using Stouffer’s method.\nState-specific marker genes in scRNA-seq data\nTo extend upon the marker genes assigned during cell-state discovery \nfrom bulk RNA-seq, we identified marker genes using the single cells \nassigned to each EcoTyper cell state20. The single-cell samples were \ngrouped into three datasets by histology: (1) SS profiled by SMART-seq2 \nfrom the external Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset15; (2) LMS profiled by 10x \nGenomics in this work; and (3) UPS profiled by 10x Genomics in this \nwork. For each of the cell states with at least 15 assigned cells in each \nscRNA-seq dataset, we calculated six metrics to prioritize marker genes \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\nfor selection: (1) the number of datasets n1 in which the mean gene \nexpression for the cell state was >0; (2) the number of datasets n2 in \nwhich the log2 fold change of the gene within the cell state was greatest \nrelative to the other cell states within the same cell type; (3) the ratio \nof n2/n1; (4) the number of datasets in which the gene was significantly \ndifferentially expressed within the cell state based on the FindMarkers \nfunction in Seurat (Q < 0.05); 5) the aggregate z score for differential \nexpression of the gene across datasets combined using Stouffer’s \nmethod; and (6) the mean log2 fold change of the gene within the cell \nstate across datasets. For each cell state, the metrics were converted \nto rank space and averaged across measures to generate a composite \nscore. The genes with the highest composite score were combined with \nmanually curated genes in Fig. 2b. All manually curated genes are noted \nin Supplementary Table 8.\nCell-state annotation\nNormal cell states were manually annotated based on the bulk RNA-seq \nand scRNA-seq marker genes. Key marker genes and references sup-\nporting each assignment are noted in Supplementary Table 10. To aid \nin the annotation of malignant cell states, we computed the overlap \nbetween the bulk RNA-seq marker genes identified by the EcoTyper \npipeline for each cell state and hallmark gene sets using the ‘Com-\npute Overlaps’ function from the MSigDB web interface (https://www.\ngsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/annotate.jsp)34,74. P values were \ncalculated from the hypergeometric distribution and the q values dis-\nplayed in Supplementary Table 9 were calculated using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Key marker genes were chosen from overlapping \ngene sets based on their expression within single cells assigned to the \nmalignant cell state.\nIHC for epithelial markers\nA tissue microarray was constructed using one to seven 1-mm FFPE \ncores per patient. IHC was performed by the Stanford Human Pathol-\nogy/Histology Service Center for CDH1, MUC1 and SDC1. Tumor cell \nstaining intensity was scored using a three-point scale (0, negative; 1, \nweak positive; and 2, strong positive).\nBiological features of SEs\nBiological features associated with each SE were analyzed in the train-\ning cohort. The percentage of patients with each sarcoma histology and \nproportion of canonical cell types were analyzed based on SE assign-\nment. Cell-type proportions were inferred using CIBERSORTx, aver-\naged and scaled. Sex and age ≥60 versus <60 years old were analyzed \nusing two-sided Wilcoxon tests comparing the relative abundance of \neach SE between groups. Hallmark gene sets were analyzed by scaling \neach gene to unit variance expression across samples before averaging \nall component genes for each gene set. Enrichment or depletion was \nanalyzed by performing a two-sided Wilcoxon test to compare the \naverage expression for each hallmark gene set in samples assigned to \neach SE versus samples assigned to the other SEs. P values were adjusted \nfor multiple-hypothesis testing and features with a q value < 0.05 were \nconsidered significant.\nAssociation of genomic alterations and mutational signatures \nwith SEs\nCNA, SNV and indel calls from the sarcomas profiled by TCGA were \ndownloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Com-\nmons Data Portal. The contributions of COSMIC mutational signatures \n1, 2, 5 and 13 were analyzed using the ‘mutSignatures’ R package75 based \non their predominance in STSs16. The proportion of patients with CNAs \nor high-impact SNVs/indels in each gene was compared across ecotypes \nusing two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. For CNAs, we analyzed COSMIC \ntier 1 genes76 mutated in at least 25% of patients. For SNVs/indels, we \nanalyzed genes mutated in at least 3% of patients. P values were cor-\nrected for multiple-hypothesis testing.\nSpatial transcriptomics\nFresh sarcoma specimens were collected and frozen in optimal cutting \ntemperature compound by the Stanford Tissue Procurement Shared \nResource. Sarcoma specimens were cryosectioned at −20 °C onto \ngene expression slides by the Stanford Genomics Shared Resource. \nPermeabilization time was optimized using 10-μm sections with the \nVisium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagents kit (10x Genom-\nics). Sequencing libraires were produced using the Visium Spatial \nGene Expression Slide & Reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to \nthe manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 \n(Illumina). Sample demultiplexing, tissue and fiducial detection, read \nalignment to the GRCh38 human reference genome and generation of \nfeature-barcode matrices was performed using Space Ranger v.1.3.0 \n(10x Genomics).\nRecovery of EcoTyper cell states and ecotypes from spatial \ntranscriptomics data\nCell state and ecotype abundance were estimated within each spatially \nbarcoded spot by imputing the fractional abundance of each sarcoma \ncell state in the Visium array using EcoTyper20. The most abundant cell \nstate per cell type within each spot was set to 1 and the rest were set to \n0. Finally, each cell state was normalized by multiplying it by the parent \ncell type fraction based on CIBERSORTx. SE abundance was calculated \nfor each spot by averaging the relative fractions of each cell state within \nthe ecotype. SE abundances were scaled so that the 99th percentile \nvalue across all three SEs was set to 1. Cell-state colocalization was \nanalyzed by computing all pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients \nbetween cell-state abundances within each spot. The distance between \nspots was calculated by quantitating the Euclidean distance between \nthe spot centers. Spatial aggregation of SEs was investigated using \nMoran’s I77 based on the relative SE abundance for each spot and the \nimmediately adjacent neighboring spots.\nLigand–receptor analysis\nTo understand the signaling networks within SEs, we analyzed the \nCIBERSORTx digitally purified cell-type-specific GEPs from STSs in \nthe training cohort for enrichment in putative ligand–receptor pairs78. \nSamples were assigned to the most abundant cell state as described \nabove. We assessed whether each ligand and receptor were overex-\npressed in samples assigned to each cell state versus all other samples \nusing one-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests. P values were corrected for \nmultiple-hypothesis testing and significantly overexpressed ligand–\nreceptor pairs across cell states were identified.\nPD-L1 staining and TLS scoring\nIHC for PD-L1 was performed on FFPE sections by the Stanford Human \nPathology/Histology Service Center using the SP263 clone antibody \nfollowing antigen retrieval with CC1 buffer for 64 min and scored \nusing the combined positive score on a representative histological \nsection of tumor. The presence of TLSs was analyzed by morphol-\nogy on H&E-stained slides of a representative section of tumor and \nscored as absent or present. PD-L1 and TLS scoring was performed by \na board-certified anatomic pathologist (G.W.C.) blinded to SEs and \nclinical outcomes.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size but \nour sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publica-\ntions8,15,16,18. Experiments were performed once. The experiments were \nnot randomized. Except for PD-L1 and TLS scoring, data collection \nand analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experi-\nments. Samples failing to meet the quality control metrics described \nabove were excluded from analysis. For the Stanford chemotherapy \nand ICI cohorts, PFS was defined as the time from the start of treat-\nment to any progression or death. Progression and response were \nNature Cancer\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00743-y\ndetermined radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria79. Patients without progression \nor death at the time of last imaging follow-up were censored. PFS \nand DMFS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and sta-\ntistical significance was determined using two-sided log-rank tests \nwhen comparing two groups or pairwise two-sided log-rank tests \nwith correction for multiple-hypothesis testing when comparing \nmultiple groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models \nwere fit with the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ R package and \nthe significance of individual variables was assessed using two-sided \nWald tests. Sarcoma cell state and ecotype abundance, tumor size and \ngrade were used as continuous variables for Cox regression, and histol-\nogy, resection extent and anatomic site were included as categorical \nvariables. Optimal cutoffs for stratifying patient outcomes based \non S01 monocyte/macrophage and S02 endothelial cell abundance \nwere defined in the training cohort using the ‘surv_cutpoint’ function \nfrom the ‘survminor’ R package with minprop of 0.2 and applied to \nthe validation cohort. The optimal cutoff for predicting response to \nICI using SE3 abundance was defined in the training cohort based on \nthe maximum Youden’s J statistic. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were \nused to compare proportions and two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests or \nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare distributions using \nnonpaired and paired samples, respectively. Correlation between \nvariables was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. \nData distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally \ntested and nonparametric tests were utilized when possible. P values \nwere corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–\nHochberg procedure. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software) \nor R through the RStudio environment.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics \ndata new to this paper have been deposited at the GEO under accession \ncodes GSE213065, GSE212527 and GSE212526, respectively.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma.

High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55).

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies.

A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies.

A completed phase I trial\n(NCT00556881) of the anti-CTLA-4 drug ipilimumab in\nchildren and adolescents with treatment-resistant cancer\nincluded sarcomas, but no results have been reported yet. A\nsecond phase II study (NCT00140855) involving ipilimumab for\npatients with synovial sarcoma was stopped early due to poor\naccrual and no objective responses.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma. Thus, it is of great importance to\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 6 | Relationship between the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation in sarcoma and pancancer.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

            "Part 1": "$Paper to be processed$: Integrated Analysis of the\nTranscriptome Proﬁle Reveals\nthe Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma\nBoran Pang 1,2 and Yongqiang Hao 1,2*\n1 Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orthopaedic Implants, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital,\nShanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China, 2 Clinical and Translational Research Center for 3D\nPrinting Technology, Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China\nBackground: Long-term survival is still low for high-risk patients with soft tissue sarcoma\ntreated with standard management options, including surgery, radiation, and\nchemotherapy. Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55).

High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A).

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies.

A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53).

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma. Thus, it is of great importance to\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 6 | Relationship between the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation in sarcoma and pancancer.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55).

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55).

Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A).

Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

A completed phase I trial\n(NCT00556881) of the anti-CTLA-4 drug ipilimumab in\nchildren and adolescents with treatment-resistant cancer\nincluded sarcomas, but no results have been reported yet. A\nsecond phase II study (NCT00140855) involving ipilimumab for\npatients with synovial sarcoma was stopped early due to poor\naccrual and no objective responses.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma. Thus, it is of great importance to\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 6 | Relationship between the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation in sarcoma and pancancer.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma.

High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A).

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma. Thus, it is of great importance to\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 6 | Relationship between the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation in sarcoma and pancancer.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma.

High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Logical Structure: 4/5**\n- **Assessment:** The protocol is organized into clear steps, each with a specific focus. Each step logically follows the previous one, creating a coherent flow from expression analysis in sarcoma to pan-cancer datasets and survival correlation.\n- **Improvement Suggestions:** Consider adding a brief introductory paragraph at the beginning of Part 2 to outline the overall objectives of this section. This would help readers understand the context and purpose of the steps that follow.\n\n**2. Detail Level: 4/5**\n- **Assessment:** The protocol provides a good level of detail regarding the methods and analyses to be performed. Each step includes specific actions to be taken, such as data collection and statistical analysis.\n- **Improvement Suggestions:** While the steps are detailed, including specific software versions or packages (e.g., R packages like `survival` for Kaplan-Meier analysis) could enhance reproducibility.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A).

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies.

A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

A completed phase I trial\n(NCT00556881) of the anti-CTLA-4 drug ipilimumab in\nchildren and adolescents with treatment-resistant cancer\nincluded sarcomas, but no results have been reported yet. A\nsecond phase II study (NCT00140855) involving ipilimumab for\npatients with synovial sarcoma was stopped early due to poor\naccrual and no objective responses.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55).

High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies. Public data, including\ndata from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nwere investigated to evaluate the role of ICLs on immune\nFIGURE 2 | Expression of ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C, and HCP5 in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05;\n**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n5\ncheckpoint inhibitors (34–37). A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53). The most successful of\nthese strategies involve immune checkpoint inhibitors. These\ninhibitors increase endogenous antitumor activity and might\nincrease the tumor immunogenicity that is induced by treatment\nwith chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. These\nexciting outcomes have led to renewed consideration of the\nimmunotherapy approach for sarcomas.\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 4 | Expression of ICLs and prognosis in human cancer.

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.

Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients\nwith sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a\nconsiderable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance.\nMethods: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these\nlncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long\nnoncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential\nroles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID\nonline software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell\ninﬁltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were\nfurther explored.\nResults: We identiﬁed lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma.\nThe expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in\nsarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of\nthese lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and\nlncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG\nand GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and\nnegative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these\nlncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and reduced sensitivity\nto immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n1\nEdited by:\nJie Sun,\nWenzhou Medical University, China\nReviewed by:\nChong Tang,\nBeijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China\nMing Li,\nBeijing Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (Beijing CDC), China\n*Correspondence:\nYongqiang Hao\nHaoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nCancer Genetics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Oncology\nReceived: 03 April 2021\nAccepted: 29 April 2021\nPublished: 11 June 2021\nCitation:\nPang B and Hao Y (2021) Integrated\nAnalysis of the Transcriptome Proﬁle\nReveals the Potential Roles Played by\nLong Noncoding RNAs in\nImmunotherapy for Sarcoma.\nFront.

Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help\nto elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and\nuncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.\nKeywords: long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistance, sarcoma\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous tumors\nwith over 100 different histological subtypes occurring\npredominantly in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneal\nareas (1). These tumors exhibit a wide range of differing\nbehaviors and underlying molecular pathologies (2–4).\nRecently, subtype-speciﬁc cancer biology has revealed distinct\nmolecular alterations responsible for tumor initiation and\nprogression. The rarity and molecular heterogeneity of\nsarcoma creates challenges for the development of targeted\ntherapeutics. Fortunately, in contrast to the genomic landscape\nof other tumor types, the genomic landscape of sarcomas is\nrelatively simple, which offers the opportunity to identify driver\nevents and translate these discoveries into clinically useful\nbiomarkers (5, 6). This may improve the understanding of\nsarcoma biology, accelerating clinical translational research.\nMultidisciplinary management is best for sarcoma therapy\n(7–12). Surgical resection with or without radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy is the standard therapy for localized sarcoma (10,\n13). Systemic therapy has a prominent role in the multidisciplinary\nmanagement of locally inoperable or metastatic sarcomas (7, 14).\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has been the mainstay therapy for treating\nadvanced-stage disease, with overall response rates of approximately\n25% in the ﬁrst-line setting. In patients with unresectable and\nmetastatic disease, the standard treatment is a single-agent\nprotocol administered with palliative intent. Despite the use of\nchemotherapy, advanced-stage sarcoma is almost invariably fatal.\nThus, it is of urgent importance to develop methods to identify the\npatients most likely to beneﬁt from current treatments and to\ndevelop novel therapeutic strategies. A number of therapeutic\ntargets for sarcoma have been developed with recent scientiﬁc\ntechnological advancements, including SRC inhibitors, MET and\nALK inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors\nand poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (15–21).\nHowever, these inhibitors yielded unsatisfactory results in\nclinical trials.\nImmunotherapy that has been used for melanoma is a new\npotential therapy paradigm that holds great promise for sarcoma\ntreatment (22–26). Immune checkpoint molecules target the\ninterface between antigen-presenting cells and T cells and require\nthe clustering of T cells and costimulatory receptors. There are\nnegative-feedback mechanisms to prevent overstimulation, which\ncan be subverted to suppress the immune system in cancer, such as\nthe upregulation of CTLA-4 expression. A signiﬁcant advance in the\nunderstanding of sarcoma immune biology is required as it has\nrecently been shown that the monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab\nand nivolumab are successful for the treatment of melanoma. The\ninhibition of CTLA-4 expression with the monoclonal antibody\nipilimumab reverses immune suppression and promotes a\nsigniﬁcant anti-cancer response in melanoma. However, while\nipilimumab given to patients with synovial sarcoma was well\ntolerated, no obvious efﬁcacy was observed (27). Therefore, the\nidentiﬁcation of potential factors leading to immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance is urgently needed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression Data and Clinical\nData Acquisition\nThe gene expression proﬁles and clinical information of patients\nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://\ncancergenome.nih.gov/). The clinical data included survival\ntime, survival status, sex, age, TNM stage, pathological stage\nand so on.\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nImmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs were identiﬁed through\nPearson correlation with immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules (CD80, CD86, CD274, PDCD1 LG2 and LGALS9)\n(R>0.3 and P < 1.00E-8) according to previous studies (28). The\nresults were analyzed online via Venny 2.1.0 software (https://\nbioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). P < 0.05 indicated\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nAnalysis of Prognosis\nOverall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) were\ndeﬁned as the time from treatment until the occurrence of death\nor progression, respectively. The log-rank test was used to\nexamine the survival difference between different patient\ngroups. P < 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance.\nGuilt-by-Association Analysis and\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis\nGuilt-by-association analysis was performed to identify immune\ncheckpoint-related lncRNAs that are positively correlated with\nthe target genes according to a previous study (29–32). Pairwise\nPearson correlation was performed between the expression of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitory molecule-related lncRNAs and all\nthe identiﬁed genes. Only positively correlated genes with an R≥\n0.5 and a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.05) were retained. Gene\nOntology term enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n2\nusing DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray\nAnalysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) software.\nDNA Methylation Analysis\nThe DNA methylation proﬁle was measured experimentally\nusing the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 platform\nfrom the TCGA. Beta values were derived at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Southern California TCGA\ngenome characterization center. DNA methylation values,\ndescribed as beta values, were recorded for each array probe in\neach sample via BeadStudio software. DNA methylation beta\nvalues are continuous variables between 0 and 1, representing the\nratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined\nlocus intensity. Thus, higher beta values represent higher levels of\nDNA methylation, and lower beta values represent lower levels\nof DNA methylation.\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Cell Inﬁltration\nMolecular data for different cancer types and clinical data were\ndownloaded from the TCGA. Moreover, the expression of\nimmune checkpoint-related lncRNAs in different cancer tissues\nand normal tissues was examined using the TIMER database\n(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/). We also reanalyzed\nimmune cell signature genes to estimate the abundance of\nimmune cells (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells) in the TIMER database. We merged the\ntumor gene expression with the reference immune cell data of\nall genes using the Bayes method, as reported in a previous\nstudy (33).\nImmune Checkpoint-Related LncRNA\nExpression and Immune Checkpoint\nInhibitor Resistance\nPublic datasets GSE78220, GSE91061, PRJEB23709, PRJNA482620,\nand phs000452.v2.p1 from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\nGEO), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and\ndbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) were downloaded to\ninvestigate immune checkpoint-related lncRNA expression and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor resistance.\nRESULT\nIdentiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint\nRelated LncRNA\nWe renamed lncRNAs that may promote tumor immune evasion\nvia regulation of immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in\nhuman sarcoma “immune checkpoint-related lncRNAs” (ICLs).\nSarcoma data from the TCGA were downloaded to analyze the\nlncRNAs positively correlated with immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecules (CD274, CD80, CD86, PDCD1 LG2 and\nLGALS9), which accelerate the process of tumor cell immune\nevasion. Nine ICLs (ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1, FCGR2C,\nHCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C) that were\npositively correlated with each of the above inhibitory\nmolecules were identiﬁed via Pearson correlation analysis\n(r>0.3, p<5E-09) (Figure 1A). The relationship between the\nidentiﬁed lncRNAs and each immune checkpoint molecule is\nshown in detail in Figures 1B–F.\nICLs Were Overexpressed and Correlated\nWith a Worse Prognosis in Human Cancer\nThe expression of nine ICLs, ADAM6, C5orf58, CXCR2P1,\nFCGR2C, HCP5, HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C, was\nfurther investigated in different cancer types, including sarcoma.\nThe results showed that the expression of nine ICLs was\nupregulated in different human cancer types (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe expression of nine ICLs was further examined in sarcoma\nand was upregulated in sarcoma compared with the expression\nof the ICLs in non-cancer tissues (Figure 4A). We obtained a\nsimilar result in agreement with that observed in sarcoma in our\nanalysis of the expression of nine ICLs in pan-cancer datasets\nwith 9,724 patients (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and patient prognosis was also\nexamined. The results showed that high expression of C5orf58\nindicated worse overall survival in the pan-cancer data (Figure\n4C). For FCGR2C, ADAM6, HCP5, NCF1B and NCF1C, we\nobtained a similar result in agreement with C5orf58 (Figures\n4D–H).\nLow DNA Methylation Modiﬁcation Leads\nto Overexpression of ICLs\nThe upstream epigenetic regulation of ICLs was further\nexamined in human cancer. The results showed low DNA\nmethylation at the ADAM6, HCP5 and NAPSB loci in\nsarcoma cancer tissues compared with that of normal tissues\n(Figures 5A–C). Next, the result was validated in the human\npan-cancer data (Figures 5D–I). Finally, the relationship\nbetween the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation was\ninvestigated in sarcoma. For C5orf58, HLA-H and NCF1C, a\nnegative correlation of the expression of ICLs and DNA\nmethylation was observed in sarcoma (Figures 6A–H). These\nresults were also validated in the human pan-cancer data.\nICLs Play Vital Roles in the Negative\nRegulation of the Immune Response\nThe guilt-by-association analysis revealed that the ICLs were\ninvolved in the regulation of key immune response processes,\nsuch as negative regulation of T cell proliferation, negative\nthymic T cell selection, negative regulation of interleukin-6,\ninterferon-gamma, interleukin-17, interleukin-12, interleukin-\n10, type I interferon, interleukin-2 and other T cell cytokine\nproduction, negative thymus T cell selection, negative regulation\nof T cell activation, negative regulation of NK cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity, negative regulation of the B cell receptor signaling\npathway and negative regulation of B cell proliferation (Figure\n7A). The potential pathways that the ICLs participated in\nincluded antigen processing and presentation, chemokine\nsignaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1\nsignaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway,\ncytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Fc\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n3\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1 | Identiﬁcation of Immune Checkpoint Related LncRNA.

The relationship between ICLs and immune cell inﬁltration\nin tumors was further examined in different cancers due to the\nﬁnding that the ICLs negatively regulate the immune response.\nAs expected, a high expression of ICLs was negatively correlated\nwith T cell regulatory (Treg) inﬁltration and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblast (CAF) inﬁltration in 33 different cancer types (Figure\n7C). Tregs and CAFs play key roles in the negative regulation of\nthe immune response, leading to tumor progression due to\nimmune evasion. Thus, the high expression of ICLs may lead\nto the failure of immunotherapy in human cancer.\nICLs Confer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\nResistance in Human Cancer\nNext, we wondered whether ICLs confer immune checkpoint\ninhibitor resistance in real-world studies.

A high expression of C5orf58 in\npatients with melanoma in different datasets (34, 37) indicated\nworse response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combined therapy,\nleading to worse overall survival or progression-free survival\n(Figures 8A, D, E). Moreover, patients with melanoma with high\nC5orf58 expression who received single anti-PD-1 monotherapy\nor anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy also showed a worse drug\nresponse, resulting in worse progression-free survival (Figures\n8B, C). In addition, glioblastoma patients with a high expression\nof C5orf58 exhibited a disappointing response to anti-PD-1\nmonotherapy and worse progression-free survival (Figure 8F).\nDISCUSSION\nThe success of adoptive cellular therapy for human cancer has\nresulted in tremendous enthusiasm for immunotherapy (38).\nRecently, immunotherapy has been approved for different\nFIGURE 3 | Expression of HLA-H, NAPSB, NCF1B and NCF1C in different human cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.\nPang and Hao\nlncRNA may Induce Immunotherapy Resistance\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\nJune 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 690486\n6\ncancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, renal\ncell carcinoma, and breast cancer (39–53).

Other inhibitory\nmolecule inhibitors targeting BTLA, LAG-3, TIM3, VISTA,\nOX40, and CD73 have been developed. However, to date, all\nclinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for sarcoma have\nyielded disappointing results with an insufﬁcient patient\nimmune response.\nPrimary resistance to immunotherapy may be due to an\nimmunosuppressive environment without a preexisting\nantitumor response (55). To some extent, immune checkpoint\ninhibitory molecule overexpression may cause an\nimmunosuppressive environment, leading to immunotherapy\nresistance in sarcoma. Thus, it is of great importance to\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nC\nFIGURE 6 | Relationship between the expression of ICLs and DNA methylation in sarcoma and pancancer.

In this study, we identiﬁed lncRNAs that might\nupregulate the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory\nmolecules in sarcoma. Moreover, these lncRNAs correlated\nwith immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune\nresponse in sarcoma. High expression of these lncRNAs\ncorrelated with more suppressive immune cell inﬁltration and\nworse sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human\ncancer. Thus, this study may indicate a potential cause of\nimmunotherapy resistance issues in sarcoma that requires\nfurther investigation. Besides this study, discovery and\nvalidation of immune-associated lncRNA biomarkers\ncorrelated with immunotherapy have been performed in breast\ncancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer (56–58). Moreover, loss\nof MHC or PTEN expression was shown to be another possible\nmechanism in sarcoma resistance to immunotherapy after an\ninitial positive response (59, 60). Thus, future clinical trials\nshould evaluate the sarcoma tumor microenvironment and the\nimmunological milieu that predicts the immune responsiveness\nof patients with sarcomas to design more effective\nimmunotherapeutics for sarcoma.\nAlthough initial immunotherapeutic trials for sarcoma\nyielded disappointing results, rational combinations of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional radiation or\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 7 | ICLs play vital roles in the negative regulation of the immune response.
