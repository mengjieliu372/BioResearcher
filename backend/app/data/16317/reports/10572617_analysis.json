    "Part 1": {
        "Title": "Samples",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "The detailed methodology for selecting tumor and normal tissue samples from relevant public projects (TCGA and GTEx) provides a strong foundation for sample acquisition in my research context, particularly for liposarcoma.",
        "Suggestions": "The datasets from the TCGA SARC project and GTEx can serve as a reference for obtaining similar data. In the protocol, clearly outline the processing methods for frozen samples and describe how they will be used in conjunction with cell lines. Additionally, specify the criteria for selecting normal tissues that closely resemble the immune microenvironment of liposarcoma."
    },
    "Part 2": {
        "Title": "Differential Expression Analysis",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "The differential expression analysis methodology using the limma package is relevant, but the focus on sarcoma subtypes may need to be adapted to concentrate specifically on liposarcoma and its immune microenvironment.",
        "Suggestions": "Adapt the statistical model to include specific immune-related genes and pathways. Provide clearer plans for how the available resources will be applied, including sample processing and integration of cell lines into the analysis. Additionally, specify how confounding variables will be controlled in the analysis."
    },
    "Part 3": {
        "Title": "Transcription Factor Enrichment Analysis",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "While the transcription factor activity analysis is crucial for understanding gene regulation in cancer, the specifics may not directly relate to the immune microenvironment analysis I plan to conduct.",
        "Suggestions": "Utilize the TFTEA method to identify key transcription factors involved in the immune responses within liposarcoma. Clearly define how previous findings have shaped the current experimental design and identify specific transcription factors that regulate immune checkpoint genes. Consider discussing the implications of these factors for potential therapeutic targets."
    },
    "Part 4": {
        "Title": "Functional Analysis",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "The functional analysis section provides valuable insights into how signaling circuits relate to cancer hallmarks, which can be applied to understand the immune microenvironment in liposarcoma.",
        "Suggestions": "Use Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to explore immune-related biological processes. Focus on the association of immune signaling pathways with the identified key genes in liposarcoma, and discuss how these findings can inform therapeutic strategies. Incorporate visual representation of the results to enhance interpretability."
    },
    "Part 5": {
        "Title": "Signal Transduction Activity",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "The methods for estimating signal transduction activities can be adapted; however, the focus on specific sarcoma subtypes may require modification to target liposarcoma and its immune aspects.",
        "Suggestions": "Use HiPathia to model the signaling pathways specifically related to immune cell interactions in liposarcoma. Emphasize the pathways relevant to tumor-immune interactions. Include potential limitations in the modeling approach and how they can be addressed."
    },
    "Part 6": {
        "Title": "Survival Analysis",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "The survival analysis methods might be useful, but they would need to be focused specifically on the correlation between immune microenvironment characteristics and patient outcomes in liposarcoma.",
        "Suggestions": "Incorporate immune-related variables into the Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate their impact on survival. Utilize Kaplan-Meier curves to visualize survival differences based on immune markers, and discuss how these findings could influence treatment strategies. Address potential confounding factors in survival analysis."
    },
    "Part 7": {
        "Title": "Data Download and Pre-processing",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "The detailed explanations of downloading and preprocessing data are directly applicable to my research, especially regarding RNA sequencing data management.",
        "Suggestions": "Follow similar protocols for obtaining RNA-seq data from public repositories. Ensure that the preprocessing steps account for the specific characteristics of the liposarcoma samples, and document any quality control measures applied to the data. Clearly describe the normalization methods and their relevance to the analysis."
    },
    "Part 8": {
        "Title": "Mechanistic Modeling of Signal Transduction",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "The mechanistic modeling techniques described are relevant but may require adjustments to focus on the signaling pathways associated with immune responses in liposarcoma.",
        "Suggestions": "Incorporate specific immune signaling pathways into the mechanistic models. Adapt the analysis to understand how these pathways might influence tumor progression and immune evasion, providing a rationale for their significance in treatment. Discuss potential limitations of the modeling approach."
    },
    "Part 9": {
        "Title": "Pathway Activity Calculation",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "The methodology for calculating pathway activity may be useful but needs to be specifically tailored to focus on pathways relevant to the immune microenvironment in liposarcoma.",
        "Suggestions": "Use the pathway activity calculations to focus on immune signaling pathways, particularly those associated with immune checkpoint activity and tumor microenvironment interactions. Provide details on the visual representation of results to enhance data interpretation and clarity."
