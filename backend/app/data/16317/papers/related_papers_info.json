            "abstract": "Soft tissue sarcoma is an umbrella term for a group of rare cancers that are difficult to treat. In addition to surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has shown the potential to downstage tumors and prevent micrometastases. However, finding effective therapeutic targets remains a research challenge. Here, a previously developed computational approach called mechanistic models of signaling pathways has been employed to unravel the impact of observed changes at the gene expression level on the ultimate functional behavior of cells. In the context of such a mechanistic model, RNA-Seq counts sourced from the Recount3 resource, from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Sarcoma project, and non-diseased sarcomagenic tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project were utilized to investigate signal transduction activity through signaling pathways. This approach provides a precise view of the relationship between sarcoma patient survival and the signaling landscape in tumors and their environment. Despite the distinct regulatory alterations observed in each sarcoma subtype, this study identified 13 signaling circuits, or elementary sub-pathways triggering specific cell functions, present across all subtypes, belonging to eight signaling pathways, which served as predictors for patient survival. Additionally, nine signaling circuits from five signaling pathways that highlighted the modifications tumor samples underwent in comparison to normal tissues were found. These results describe the protective role of the immune system, suggesting an anti-tumorigenic effect in the tumor microenvironment, in the process of tumor cell detachment and migration, or the dysregulation of ion homeostasis. Also, the analysis of signaling circuit intermediary proteins suggests multiple strategies for therapy.",

Nonetheless, a thorough analysis examining the relationship between the PEA3 subfamily members and tumour development, prognosis, and the tumour microenvironment (TME) across various cancer types has not yet been conducted. The expression profiles and prognostic significance of the PEA3 subfamily were evaluated using data from the GEO, TCGA, and PrognoScan databases, in conjunction with COX regression analyses and the Kaplan–Meier Plotter. Furthermore, the relationships between PEA3 subfamily expression, stemness scores, tumor microenvironments, immune subtypes, and drug susceptibility across multiple cancer types were explored. We found that ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5 are highly expressed in cancer, and their biological functions are synergistic. In the prognostic analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas, the PEA3 subfamily genes were found to be associated with the prognosis of multiple cancers such as Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), etc., and marked a worse prognosis at different endpoints. In addition, it was significantly correlated with the stromal and immune scores of pan-cancer, and also significantly associated with the RNA stemness score and DNA stemness score of pan-cancer. Expression levels of the PEA3 subfamily genes correlate with immune subtypes of LIHC, LUAD, and Lung squamous cell carcinoma. We also found a variety of drugs with positive and negative associations of ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5.

            "abstract": "<p>Liposarcoma is one of the most prevalent forms of soft tissue sarcoma, and its prognosis is highly dependent on its molecular subtypes. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) like microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can bind various cellular targets to regulate carcinogenesis. By affecting the expressions and activities of their downstream targets post-transcriptionally, dysregulations of miRNAs can alter different oncogenic signalling pathways, mediating liposarcoma progression. On the contrary, lncRNAs can sponge miRNAs to spare their downstream targets from translational repression, indirectly affecting miRNA-regulated oncogenic activities. In the past 15 years, multiple fundamental and clinical research has shown that different ncRNAs play essential roles in modulating liposarcoma development. Yet, there is a lack of an effective review report that could summarize the findings from various studies. To narrow this literature gap, this review article aimed to compare the findings from different studies on the tumour-regulatory roles of ncRNAs in liposarcoma and to understand how ncRNAs control liposarcoma progression mechanistically. Additionally, the reported findings were critically reviewed to evaluate the translational potentials of various ncRNAs in clinical applications, including employing these ncRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers or as therapeutic targets in the management of liposarcoma. Overall, over 15 ncRNAs were reported to play essential roles in modulating different cellular pathways, including apoptosis, WNT/β-catenin, TGF-β/SMAD4, EMT, interleukin, and YAP-associated pathways to influence liposarcoma development. 28 ncRNAs were reported to be upregulated in liposarcoma tissues or circulation, whereas 11 were downregulated, making them potential candidates as liposarcoma diagnostic biomarkers. Among these ncRNAs, measuring the tissues or circulating levels of miR-155 and miR-195 was reported to help detect liposarcoma, differentiate liposarcoma subtypes, and predict the survival and treatment response of liposarcoma patients. Overall, except for a few ncRNAs like miR-155 and miR-195, current evidence to support the use of discussed ncRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in managing liposarcoma is mainly based on a single-center study with relatively small sample sizes or cell-based studies. Hence, more large-scale multi-center studies should be conducted to further confirm the sensitivity, specificity, and safety of ncRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Instead of furthering investigation to confirm the translational values of all the discussed ncRNAs, which can be time- and cost-consuming, it would be more practical to focus on a few ncRNAs, including miR-155 and miR-195, to evaluate if they are sensitive and safe to be used as liposarcoma biomarkers and therapeutic agents or targets.</p>",

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to evaluate different serum protein levels in 128 blood samples from patients with RLPS.

RNA sequencing analysis revealed that 1,630 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in lipid metabolism, developmental process, and extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways. Integrated lipidomic and transcriptomic analysis identified 29 genes as potential biomarkers between WDLPS and DDLPS. Among the 29 DEGs, we found that TIMP1, FN1, MMP11, GPNMB, and ECM1 were increased in DDLPS tumor tissues than in WDLPS tumor tissues. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed high specificity and sensitivity in diagnosing patients using a five-gene combination (AUC = 0.904).

Translation of other therapies have not been successful and there has been no significant improvement in prognosis for nearly 20 years. The aberrant activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway has been implicated in the aggressive clinical behavior LPS and in resistance to chemotherapy, but the precise mechanism remains elusive and efforts to target AKT clinically have failed. Here we show that the AKT-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription elongation factor IWS1, promotes the maintenance of cancer stem cells in both cell and xenograft models of LPS. In addition, phosphorylation of IWS1 by AKT contributes to a “metastable” cell phenotype, characterized by mesenchymal/epithelial plasticity. The expression of phosphorylated IWS1 also promotes anchorage-dependent and independent growth, cell migration, invasion, and tumor metastasis. In patients with LPS, IWS1 expression is associated with reduced overall survival, increased frequency of recurrence, and shorter time to relapse after resection. These findings indicate that IWS1-mediated transcription elongation is an important regulator of human LPS pathobiology in an AKT-dependent manner and implicate IWS1 as an important molecular target to treat LPS.</p>\n      ",
