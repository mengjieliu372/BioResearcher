However, the molecular mechanisms driving the interactions between these two diseases remain incompletely understood. This study aims to explore the transcriptomic commonalities and molecular pathways shared by RB and OS, and to identify biomarkers that predict OS prognosis effectively. RNA sequences and patient information for OS and RB were obtained from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Xena and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. When RB and OS were first identified, a common gene expression profile was discovered. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) revealed co-expression networks associated with OS after immunotyping patients. To evaluate the genes shared by RB and OS, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were then carried out. Three machine learning methods were used to pick key genes, and risk models were created and verified. Next, medications that target independent prognostic genes were found using the Cellminer database. The comparison of differential gene expression between OS and RB revealed 1216 genes, primarily linked to the activation and proliferation of immune cells. WGCNA identified 12 modules related to OS immunotyping, with the grey module showing a strong correlation with the immune-inflamed phenotype. This module intersected with differential genes from RB, producing 65 RB-associated OS Immune-inflamed Genes (ROIGs). Analysis identified 6 hub genes for model construction through univariate Cox regression and three machine learning techniques. A risk model based on these hub genes was established, demonstrating significant prognostic value for OS. Genes shared between OS and RB contribute to the progression of both cancers through multiple pathways. The ROIGs risk score model independently predicts the overall survival of OS patients.

Cancer continues to be a significant global disease burden. In the past, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were the main cancer treatments. The technology of cancer treatments continues to develop and advance, and the emergence of targeted therapy, and immunotherapy provides more options for patients to a certain extent. However, the limitations of efficacy and treatment resistance are still inevitable. Our review begins with a brief introduction of the historical discoveries, original hypotheses, and pathways that regulate CSCs, such as WNT/β-Catenin, hedgehog, Notch, NF-κB, JAK/STAT, TGF-β, PI3K/AKT, PPAR pathway, and their crosstalk. We focus on the role of CSCs in various therapeutic outcomes and resistance, including how the treatments affect the content of CSCs and the alteration of related molecules, CSCs-mediated therapeutic resistance, and the clinical value of targeting CSCs in patients with refractory, progressed or advanced tumors. In summary, CSCs affect therapeutic efficacy, and the treatment method of targeting CSCs is still difficult to determine. Clarifying regulatory mechanisms and targeting biomarkers of CSCs is currently the mainstream idea.</p>",

Our retrospective clinical study found that WD patients have a significantly higher incidence of cholecystitis and a poorer prognosis. The hepatic immune cell landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing showed that the tissue immune microenvironment is altered in WD, mainly a major change in the constitution and function of the innate immune system.

        "abstract": "Metabolic elevation in soft-tissue sarcomas (STS), as documented with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) has been linked with cell proliferation, higher grade, and lower survivals. However, the recent diagnostic innovations (CINSARC gene-expression signature and tertiary lymphoid structure [TLS]) and therapeutic innovations (immune checkpoint inhibitors [ICIs]) for STS patients underscore the need to re-assess the role of 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Thus, in this correspondence, our objective was to investigate the correlations between STS metabolism as assessed by nuclear imaging, and the immune landscape as estimated by transcriptomics analysis, immunohistochemistry panels, and TLS assessment. Based on a prospective cohort of 85 adult patients with high-grade STS recruited in the NEOSARCOMICS trial (NCT02789384), we identified 3 metabolic groups according to 18F-FDG-PET/CT metrics (metabolic-low [60%], -intermediate [15.3%] and high [24.7%]). We found that T-cells CD8 pathway was significantly enriched in metabolic-high STS. Conversely, several pathways involved in antitumor immune response, cell differentiation and cell cycle, were downregulated in extreme metabolic-low STS. Next, multiplex immunofluorescence showed that densities of CD8+, CD14+, CD45+, CD68+, and c-MAF cells were significantly higher in the metabolic-high group compared to the metabolic-low group. Lastly, no association was found between metabolic group and TLS status. Overall, these results suggest that (i) rapidly proliferating and metabolically active STS can instigate a more robust immune response, thereby attracting immune cells such as T cells and macrophages, and (ii) metabolic activity and TLS could independently influence immune responses.",

        "abstract": "<p>Liposarcoma is one of the most prevalent forms of soft tissue sarcoma, and its prognosis is highly dependent on its molecular subtypes. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) like microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can bind various cellular targets to regulate carcinogenesis. By affecting the expressions and activities of their downstream targets post-transcriptionally, dysregulations of miRNAs can alter different oncogenic signalling pathways, mediating liposarcoma progression. On the contrary, lncRNAs can sponge miRNAs to spare their downstream targets from translational repression, indirectly affecting miRNA-regulated oncogenic activities. In the past 15 years, multiple fundamental and clinical research has shown that different ncRNAs play essential roles in modulating liposarcoma development. Yet, there is a lack of an effective review report that could summarize the findings from various studies. To narrow this literature gap, this review article aimed to compare the findings from different studies on the tumour-regulatory roles of ncRNAs in liposarcoma and to understand how ncRNAs control liposarcoma progression mechanistically. Additionally, the reported findings were critically reviewed to evaluate the translational potentials of various ncRNAs in clinical applications, including employing these ncRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers or as therapeutic targets in the management of liposarcoma. Overall, over 15 ncRNAs were reported to play essential roles in modulating different cellular pathways, including apoptosis, WNT/β-catenin, TGF-β/SMAD4, EMT, interleukin, and YAP-associated pathways to influence liposarcoma development. 28 ncRNAs were reported to be upregulated in liposarcoma tissues or circulation, whereas 11 were downregulated, making them potential candidates as liposarcoma diagnostic biomarkers. Among these ncRNAs, measuring the tissues or circulating levels of miR-155 and miR-195 was reported to help detect liposarcoma, differentiate liposarcoma subtypes, and predict the survival and treatment response of liposarcoma patients. Overall, except for a few ncRNAs like miR-155 and miR-195, current evidence to support the use of discussed ncRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in managing liposarcoma is mainly based on a single-center study with relatively small sample sizes or cell-based studies. Hence, more large-scale multi-center studies should be conducted to further confirm the sensitivity, specificity, and safety of ncRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Instead of furthering investigation to confirm the translational values of all the discussed ncRNAs, which can be time- and cost-consuming, it would be more practical to focus on a few ncRNAs, including miR-155 and miR-195, to evaluate if they are sensitive and safe to be used as liposarcoma biomarkers and therapeutic agents or targets.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p id=\"Par1\">Cancer is a global health problem and one of the leading causes of mortality. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the field of oncology, emerging as a powerful treatment strategy. A key pathway that has garnered considerable attention is programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1). The interaction between PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and PD-1 reduces the innate immune response and thus compromises the capability of the body’s immune system. Furthermore, it controls the phenotype and functionality of innate and adaptive immune components. A range of monoclonal antibodies, including avelumab, atezolizumab, camrelizumab, dostarlimab, durvalumab, sinitilimab, toripalimab, and zimberelimab, have been developed for targeting the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1. These agents can induce a broad spectrum of autoimmune-like complications that may affect any organ system. Recent studies have focused on the effect of various natural compounds that inhibit immune checkpoints. This could contribute to the existing arsenal of anticancer drugs. Several bioactive natural agents have been shown to affect the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis, promoting tumor cell apoptosis, influencing cell proliferation, and eventually leading to tumor cell death and inhibiting cancer progression. However, there is a substantial knowledge gap regarding the role of different natural compounds targeting PD-1 in the context of cancer. Hence, this review aims to provide a common connection between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and the anticancer effects of distinct natural molecules. Moreover, the primary focus will be on the underlying mechanism of action as well as the clinical efficacy of bioactive molecules. Current challenges along with the scope of future research directions targeting PD-1/PD-L1 interactions through natural substances are also discussed.</p>",

Therefore, current global research focuses on molecular tools for early diagnosis of HCC, which can lead to effective treatment at an early stage. Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) has been studied as one of the main proteins of the perilipin family, whose role is to maintain lipid homeostasis by inhibiting lipolysis. In this study, we show for the first time that PLIN5 is strongly expressed in tumors of human patients with HCC as well as in mouse livers, in which HCC was genetically or experimentally induced by treatment with the genotoxic agent diethylnitrosamine. Moreover, the secreted acute phase glycoprotein Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) established as a biomarker of acute kidney injury, is also proven to indicate liver injury with upregulated expression in numerous cases of hepatic damage, including steatohepatitis. LCN2 has been studied in various cancers, and it has been assigned roles in multiple cellular processes such as the suppression of the invasion of HCC cells and their metastatic abilities. The presence of this protein in blood and urine, in combination with the presence of α-Fetoprotein (AFP), is hypothesized to serve as a biomarker of early stages of HCC. In the current study, we show in humans and mice that LCN2 is secreted into the serum from liver cancer tissue. We also show that AFP-positive hepatocytes represent the main source for the massive expression of LCN2 in tumoral tissue. Thus, the strong presence of PLIN5 and LCN2 in HCC and understanding their roles could establish them as markers for diagnosis or as treatment targets against HCC.</p>\n      ",

However, research for BRCA were limited to single immune checkpoint-related gene (ICG) and few studies have systematically explored expression profile of Immune checkpoint-related genes or attempted to construct a prognostic gene risk model based on immune checkpoint-related genes. We identified immune checkpoint-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BRCA and normal breast tissues from TCGA database. A 7-gene signature was created by utilizing the univariate Cox regression model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression method. In addition, we conducted a nomogram to predict the prognostic significance. This tool enables quantitative prediction of patient prognosis, serving as a valuable reference for clinical decision-making, thereby improving patient outcomes. Relationships between our risk model and clinical indicators, TME (Tumor Microenvironment), immune cell infiltration, immune response and drug susceptibility were investigated. A set of in vitro cell assays was conducted to decipher the relationship between MAP2K6 and proliferation, invasion, migration, colony formation and apoptosis rate of breast cancer cells. As a result, we established a prognostic model composed of seven ICGs in BRCA. Based on the median risk score, BRCA patients were equally assigned into two groups of high- and low-risk. High-risk BRCA patients have poorer OS (overall survival) than low-risk patients. In addition, there were remarkable differences between these two groups in clinicopathological features, TME, immune cell infiltration, immune response and drug susceptibility. The results of GO and KEGG analyses indicated that DEGs between the high- and low-risk groups were involved in immune-related biological processes and pathways. GSEA analysis also showed that a number of immune-related pathways were notably enriched in the low-risk group. Finally, results of cell-based assays indicated that MAP2K6 may play a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of breast cancer as a tumor suppressor gene. In conclusion, we created a novel ICG signature that has the potential to predict the survival and drug sensitivity of BRCA patients. Furthermore, this study indicated that MAP2K6 may serve as a novel target for BRCA therapy.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>Astragalus membranaceus (AM) herb is a component of traditional Chinese medicine used to treat various cancers. Herein, we demonstrate a strong anti-leukemic effect of AM injected (Ai) into the mouse model of erythroleukemia induced by Friend virus. Chemical analysis combined with mass spectrometry of AM/Ai identified the compounds Betulinic acid, Kaempferol, Hederagenin, and formononetin, all major mediators of leukemia inhibition in culture and in vivo. Docking analysis demonstrated binding of these four compounds to FLI1, resulting in downregulation of its targets, induction of apoptosis, differentiation, and suppression of cell proliferation. Chemical composition analysis identified other compounds previously known having anti-tumor activity independent of the FLI1 blockade. Among these, Astragaloside-A (As-A) has marginal effect on cells in culture, but strongly inhibits leukemogenesis in vivo, likely through improvement of anti-tumor immunity. Indeed, both IDO1 and TDO2 were identified as targets of As-A, leading to suppression of tryptophane-mediated Kyn production and leukemia suppression. Moreover, As-A interacts with histamine decarboxylase (HDC), leading to suppression of anti-inflammatory genes TNF, IL1B/IL1A, TNFAIP3, and CXCR2, but not IL6. These results implicate HDC as a novel immune checkpoint mediator, induced in the tumor microenvironment to promote leukemia. Functional analysis of AM components may allow development of combination therapy with optimal anti-leukemia effect.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p id=\"Par1\">Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for patients with advanced liposarcoma (LPS), but response rates are only 25% and the overall survival at 5 years is dismal at 20–34%. Translation of other therapies have not been successful and there has been no significant improvement in prognosis for nearly 20 years. The aberrant activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway has been implicated in the aggressive clinical behavior LPS and in resistance to chemotherapy, but the precise mechanism remains elusive and efforts to target AKT clinically have failed. Here we show that the AKT-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription elongation factor IWS1, promotes the maintenance of cancer stem cells in both cell and xenograft models of LPS. In addition, phosphorylation of IWS1 by AKT contributes to a “metastable” cell phenotype, characterized by mesenchymal/epithelial plasticity. The expression of phosphorylated IWS1 also promotes anchorage-dependent and independent growth, cell migration, invasion, and tumor metastasis. In patients with LPS, IWS1 expression is associated with reduced overall survival, increased frequency of recurrence, and shorter time to relapse after resection. These findings indicate that IWS1-mediated transcription elongation is an important regulator of human LPS pathobiology in an AKT-dependent manner and implicate IWS1 as an important molecular target to treat LPS.</p>\n      ",

Using a murine monoclonal antibody surrogate of Oleclumab, we investigated the effect of CD73 inhibition in concert with cytotoxic therapies (chemotherapies as well as fractionated radiotherapy) and PD-L1 blockade. Our results highlight improved survival in syngeneic tumor models of colorectal cancer (CT26 and MC38) and sarcoma (MCA205). This therapeutic outcome was in part driven by cytotoxic CD8 T-cells, as evidenced by the detrimental effect of CD8 depleting antibody treatment of MCA205 tumor bearing mice treated with anti-CD73, anti-PD-L1 and 5-Fluorouracil+Oxaliplatin (5FU+OHP). We hypothesize that the improved responses are tumor microenvironment (TME)-driven, as suggested by the lack of anti-CD73 enhanced cytopathic effects mediated by 5FU+OHP on cell lines in vitro. Pharmacodynamic analysis, using imaging mass cytometry and RNA-sequencing, revealed noteworthy changes in specific cell populations like cytotoxic T cells, B cells and NK cells in the CT26 TME. Transcriptomic analysis highlighted treatment-related modulation of gene profiles associated with an immune response, NK and T-cell activation, T cell receptor signaling and interferon (types 1 & 2) pathways. Inclusion of comparator groups representing the various components of the combination allowed deconvolution of contribution of the individual therapeutic elements; highlighting specific effects mediated by the anti-CD73 antibody with respect to immune-cell representation, chemotaxis and myeloid biology. These pre-clinical data reflect complementarity of adenosine blockade with cytotoxic therapy, and T-cell checkpoint inhibition, and provides new mechanistic insights in support of combination therapy.",

Recent studies have highlighted the role of alternative splicing in cancer metastasis, although the precise mechanisms underlying aberrant splicing in OS invasion and metastasis remain unclear. Here, we analyzed consistently differentially expressed genes and differentially alternative splicing events between primary and metastatic OS to identify potential genes associated with OS progression. U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 70K (SNRNP70) emerged as both differentially expressed and spliced, with elevated SNRNP70 levels correlating with poor prognosis in pateints with OS. Functional experiments demonstrated that SNRNP70 overexpression enhanced the proliferation and metastasis of OS cells in vitro, while its depletion reduced these capabilities in vivo. Mechanistically, SNRNP70 directly interacted with CD55, modulating its alternative splicing and promoting tumor progression in OS. Additionally, metastatic OS samples exhibited increased infiltration of resting immune cells, and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed communication between SNRNP70-expressing osteoblastic cells and macrophages via the ADGRE5/CD55 signaling pathway. Overall, our results showed that SNRNP70 knockdown inhibited OS progression, which was associated with the splicing of CD55, indicating SNRNP70 as a promising target for OS treatment.",

In addition to surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has shown the potential to downstage tumors and prevent micrometastases. However, finding effective therapeutic targets remains a research challenge. Here, a previously developed computational approach called mechanistic models of signaling pathways has been employed to unravel the impact of observed changes at the gene expression level on the ultimate functional behavior of cells. In the context of such a mechanistic model, RNA-Seq counts sourced from the Recount3 resource, from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Sarcoma project, and non-diseased sarcomagenic tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project were utilized to investigate signal transduction activity through signaling pathways. This approach provides a precise view of the relationship between sarcoma patient survival and the signaling landscape in tumors and their environment. Despite the distinct regulatory alterations observed in each sarcoma subtype, this study identified 13 signaling circuits, or elementary sub-pathways triggering specific cell functions, present across all subtypes, belonging to eight signaling pathways, which served as predictors for patient survival. Additionally, nine signaling circuits from five signaling pathways that highlighted the modifications tumor samples underwent in comparison to normal tissues were found. These results describe the protective role of the immune system, suggesting an anti-tumorigenic effect in the tumor microenvironment, in the process of tumor cell detachment and migration, or the dysregulation of ion homeostasis.

TILT-123 (igrelimogene litadenorepvec, Ad5/3-E2F-D24-hTNFα-IRES-hIL-2) is a chimeric oncolytic adenovirus suitable for intravenous (i.v.) delivery due to its capsid modification and dual selectivity devices. It is armed with tumor necrosis alpha and interleukin-2 for promoting T-cell activation and lymphocyte trafficking to tumors, thereby enhancing the antitumor immune response.

Most TCRs of clinical interest are evaluated in immunocompromised mice to enable human T-cell engraftment and do not recapitulate the dynamic interplay that occurs with endogenous immunity in a treated patient. A variety of humanized mouse models have been described but they have limitations in immune reconstitution and are technically challenging to implement. Here, we have developed a chimeric syngeneic tumor model in which A2Kb transgenic C57BL/6 mice are engrafted with B16 expressing A2Kb:NY as a single chain trimer (SCT) and treated by ACT with murine T cells expressing A2/NY TCRs comprising human variable fused to mouse constant regions.</p> <p>We compared the function of a supraphysiological affinity A2/NY TCR (wtc51m), a computationally designed TCR in an optimal affinity range (DMβ), and a near non-binding TCR (V49I), engineered in both primary human and murine T cells by lentiviral and retroviral transduction, respectively. We evaluated a variety of strategies to stably express A2Kb:NY on the surface of mouse tumor cell lines including B16 melanoma, ultimately achieving success with an SCT comprising human β2m fused by GS linkers to both the NY-peptide and to α1 of the HLA complex.

        "abstract": "Therapeutic options for synovial sarcoma (SyS) have not evolved for several decades and the efficacy of second-line treatments is very limited. The expression of a large family of proteins known as cancer testis antigens (CTAs) in SyS has spurred the development of targeted T-cell therapies currently in clinical trials, such as those aimed at melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE)-A4 and New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1), which have shown promising clinical efficacy. Extensive knowledge of the prevalence of expression and coexpression of CTAs is critical to design T-cell therapies with optimal coverage of the patient population. We analyzed the expression of CTAs of the MAGE-A family as well as NY-ESO-1 and preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) by RNA sequencing in a large cohort of 133 SyS samples from patients registered in the French sarcoma database (NETSARC+). Among MAGE-As, MAGE-A4 had the highest prevalence (65%), followed by MAGE-A10 (15%) and MAGE-A9 (13%). Almost all samples (92%) expressing any of the MAGE-As also expressed MAGE-A4. NY-ESO-1 was expressed in 65% of samples, with a large but incomplete overlap with MAGE-A4, whereas PRAME was present in 121 (91%) samples. Complementary immunohistochemical analyses were used to establish the positive correlation between RNA and protein expression for MAGE-A4 and NY-ESO-1. These data inform the strategy for optimal coverage of the SyS patient population with T-cell therapies, offering patients with SyS new options for single or combined second lines of treatment.",

Differentially expressed genes and pathways as well as immune signatures between H2AXhigh- and H2AXlow tumors were identified with DESeq2 analysis, gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA), Enrichr pathway analysis and CIBERSORTx. Tissue microarrays of a different cohort of 291 STS were generated for immunohistochemical staining to assess γ-H2AX protein expression, followed by statistical evaluation. High H2AX mRNA expression was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) in STS (p = 0.02), particularly in leiomyosarcomas (LMS) (p < 0.001), and was a negative prognostic factor in LMS (HR 11.15, p < 0.001). H2AXhigh LMS tumors showed upregulation of cell cycle-related pathways, while H2AXlow LMS exhibited increased inflammatory activity, including elevated M1 macrophage signatures and resting mast cell signatures (both p < 0.001). High γ-H2AX protein levels were an independent negative prognostic factor in the total LMS cohort (HR 12.12, p = 0.025) and in the subgroup of non-uterine LMS (HR 153.80, p = 0.013). Consistent with CIBERSORTx analysis, γ-H2AXlow LMS showed higher mast cell infiltration than γ-H2AXhigh LMS (p = 0.038).

        "abstract": "<p id=\"Par1\">Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with poor prognosis and a common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and despite ongoing therapeutic breakthroughs, patient survival benefits are limited. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and poses a major threat to humanity worldwide. As the epidemic continues to develop, more and more people are infected with SARS-CoV-2, including patients with HCC. However, the relationship between COVID-19 and HCC has not yet been fully elucidated. Our study aimed to identify the shared genetic characteristics and molecular mechanisms between COVID-19 and HCC. The data involved in this study come from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression(GTEx), and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia(CCLE) databases. We used differentially expressed genes to perform enrichment analysis to reveal the biological landscape of COVID-19 combined with HCC. In addition, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to study the co-expression network related to COVID-19 and HCC. We then combined the validation datasets to screen out immunoglobulin superfamily member 1 (IGSF1) as the most important core gene. Finally, we extensively studied the functional expression of IGSF1 in tumor samples, normal tissues, and cancer cell lines. The molecular mechanisms related to COVID-19 and HCC are rarely studied. Our study identifies IGSF1 as a potential therapeutic target and immune-related biomarker for patients with COVID-19 and HCC.</p> <p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12672-024-01483-2.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>Objective: Thymidylate synthase (TYMS) constitutes a pivotal and potent target in the context of chemoresistance. However, the oncogenic role of TYMS has received insufficient attention. Methods: Leveraging data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and various public databases, we conducted an extensive investigation into the oncogenic role of TYMS across 33 cancer types. Subsequently, TYMS was inhibited using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in four different cell lines, and cell proliferation and migration were assessed using CellTiter-Glo and Transwell assays. Results: TYMS exhibited pronounced expression across a spectrum of cancers and demonstrated associations with clinical outcome in diverse cancer patient cohorts. Furthermore, genetic alterations were identified as potential influencers of overall survival in specific tumor types. Notably, the expression of thymidylate synthase correlated with tumor-infiltrating CD4+ cells in select cancers. Additionally, the functional mechanism of TYMS encompassed nucleotidase activity, chromosome segregation, and DNA replication progress. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments further substantiated these findings, demonstrating that the suppression of TYMS impeded the cell growth and invasive capabilities of HeLa, A549, 786-O, and U87_MG cells. Conclusions: This study furnishes a comprehensive understanding of the oncogenic role played by TYMS in human tumors.</p>",
