Here we investigated the impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin topology, gene expression and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma tumors and models. We identified three independent gene regulatory circuits that predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 family transcription factors bind a shared set of enhancers associated with mesenchymal lineage genes that underlie the developmental state of these tumors. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters associated with P53 pathways. When highly expressed, MDM2 also binds an additional set of P53-independent promoters that engage in multi-way physical interactions and regulate genes involved in cell division, RNA splicing, translation and stress responses. We find that liposarcoma cells with low to moderate MDM2 levels are sensitive to P53 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic agents, but that cells with very high-level MDM2 amplification and expression resist treatment. Hence, heterogeneity of MDM2 expression between and within tumors may compromise therapeutic regimens.

The two most frequent subtypes well differentiated (WD) and dedifferentiated (DD) LPS are often marked with the giant chromosome and the amplifications of chromosome 12q13-15. However, it remains unknown how this genomic aberrancy contributes to the dysregulation of the oncogenes. Here, we reported a comprehensive molecular characterization of both tumor and normal tissues from the same batch of LPS patients, including Hi-C, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and WGS datasets. We identified a library of tumor-specific enhancers that may play a critical role in oncogenesis. We also demonstrated the enhancer co-amplification and hijacking events involved with proto-oncogenes such as MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2, which have not been previously reported and as a novel mechanism to upregulate these genes. By combining Hi-C, optical mapping, Nanopore long reads and WGS data, we partially resolved complex structure variations (SVs) and reconstructed the local genome and the giant chromosome. We further validated the presence of multiple copies of  MDM2 and CDK4 are located on the giant chromosome by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

Each pair of patient samples contains one tumor tissue and one matched peritumoral tissue as control. To profile the transcribed regions and to reveal the differential transcriptomes between tumors and peritumoral tissues, we performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) in all patient samples and cell lines. In 4 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples (P241, P298, P69 and P209) and 1 DD-LPS cell line (Lipo863B), we performed 1) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA-seq (ChIP-seq) for histone modifications H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), to chart the open chromatin regions and DD-LPS-specific regulatory elements, such as enhancers; 2) Hi-C experiments to study high-order chromatin structure and link distal enhancers to their target genes; 3) whole genome sequencing (WGS) to profile CNVs and dissect genome rearrangements. To better reveal the sequence details of genome rearrangements, we performed Nanopore long-read sequencing and BioNano optical mapping in Lipo863B cells to help assemble the rearranged regions.

Transcription factors (TFs), including fusion oncoproteins, can bind to BAF complex surfaces to direct chromatin targeting and accessibility, often activating oncogenic gene loci. Here, we demonstrate that the FUS-DDIT3 fusion oncoprotein hallmark to myxoid liposarcoma (MLPS) inhibits BAF complex-mediated remodeling of adipogenic enhancer sites via sequestration of the adipogenic TF, CEBPB, from the genome. In mesenchymal stem cells, small molecule inhibition of BAF complex ATPase activity attenuates adipogenesis via failure of BAF-mediated DNA accessibility and gene activation at CEBPB target sites genome-wide. BAF chromatin targeting and gene expression profiles of FUS-DDIT3-expressing cell lines and primary tumors exhibit similarity to SMARCB1-deficient BAF loss-of-function tumor types.

It is characterized by a component of undifferentiated tumor cells coexisting with a component of well-differentiated adipocytic tumor cells. Both dedifferentiated (DD) and well-differentiated (WD) components exhibit MDM2 amplification, however their cellular origin remains elusive. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and functional assays in paired WD and DD components from primary DDLPS tumors, we characterized the cellular heterogeneity of DDLPS tumor and micro-environment. We identified a population of tumor adipocyte stem cells (ASC) showing striking similarities with adipocyte stromal progenitors found in white adipose tissue. We show that tumor ASC harbor the ancestral genomic alterations of WD and DD components, suggesting that both derive from these progenitors following clonal evolution.

Detail Level:\n- **Strengths:** The protocol provides specific commands and code snippets for downloading data from Recount3, which is helpful for replication. It also mentions the use of specific software versions (e.g., STAR version 2.7.3a, Megadepth version 1.0.1).\n- **Weaknesses:** The protocol could benefit from more detailed instructions on how to handle potential errors or issues during the data download process. Additionally, while it mentions downloading datasets from GEO, it does not provide specific commands or steps for this process.\n\n#### 2. Factual Reliability:\n- **Strengths:** The details provided are accurate and align with standard practices for downloading and processing RNA-seq data.\n- **Weaknesses:** The protocol assumes that the user is familiar with the Recount3 and GEO platforms. It could include more background information or references to documentation for users who are less experienced.\n\n#### 3. Relevance:\n- **Strengths:** The protocol is highly relevant to the research objective of collecting and preparing RNA-seq data from sarcoma samples.\n- **Weaknesses:** The protocol could be more explicit about how the downloaded data will be used in subsequent steps of the experiment.\n\n#### 4. Referability and Modifications:\n- **Strengths:** The protocol reflects recommendations for referability by including specific datasets and software versions.\n- **Weaknesses:** It does not explicitly mention any modifications that might be necessary based on the analysis of the referenced sources.\n\n#### 5. Logical Structure:\n- **Strengths:** The protocol follows a logical sequence, starting with data download and moving towards data processing.\n- **Weaknesses:** The structure could be improved by breaking down the steps into smaller, more manageable tasks. For example, separating the download process for Recount3 and GEO datasets into distinct sub-steps.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n1. **Detail Level:** \n   - Include more detailed instructions for handling potential errors during the data download process.\n   - Provide specific commands or steps for downloading datasets from GEO.\n   - Add background information or references to documentation for users who are less experienced with Recount3 and GEO.\n\n2. **Factual Reliability:** \n   - Ensure that all steps are clearly explained and that any assumptions about the user's knowledge are minimized.\n\n3. **Relevance:** \n   - Be more explicit about how the downloaded data will be used in subsequent steps of the experiment.\n\n4. **Referability and Modifications:** \n   - Mention any potential modifications that might be necessary based on the analysis of the referenced sources.\n\n5. **Logical Structure:** \n   - Break down the steps into smaller, more manageable tasks.\n   - Separate the download process for Recount3 and GEO datasets into distinct sub-steps.\n\n### Final Integral Score:\nConsidering the strengths and areas for improvement, I would rate this part of the protocol a **3.5** out of 5.

Detail Level:\n- **Strengths:** The protocol provides clear criteria for selecting tumor and normal samples, including specific tissue sites and quality metrics (e.g., percentage of aligned reads > 70%). It also specifies the prioritization of highly differentiated (WDLPS) and dedifferentiated (DDLPS) liposarcoma samples.\n- **Weaknesses:** The protocol could benefit from more detailed instructions on how to perform the visual inspection of data distribution and how to modify subtype classification based on expert pathology reviews. Additionally, it could include more specific examples or references to supplementary information for clarity.\n\n#### 2. Factual Reliability:\n- **Strengths:** The details provided are accurate and align with standard practices for selecting RNA-seq samples based on quality metrics and expert reviews.\n- **Weaknesses:** The protocol assumes that the user has access to expert pathology reviews and supplementary information, which may not always be the case. It could include alternative methods for users who do not have access to these resources.\n\n#### 3. Relevance:\n- **Strengths:** The protocol is highly relevant to the research objective of analyzing differences in metabolic characteristics between highly differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma.\n- **Weaknesses:** The protocol could be more explicit about how the selected samples will be used in subsequent steps of the experiment.\n\n#### 4. Referability and Modifications:\n- **Strengths:** The protocol reflects recommendations for referability by including specific datasets and quality metrics.\n- **Weaknesses:** It does not explicitly mention any modifications that might be necessary based on the analysis of the referenced sources.\n\n#### 5. Logical Structure:\n- **Strengths:** The protocol follows a logical sequence, starting with the selection of tumor samples and moving towards the selection of normal samples.\n- **Weaknesses:** The structure could be improved by breaking down the steps into smaller, more manageable tasks. For example, separating the selection criteria for tumor and normal samples into distinct sub-steps.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n1. **Detail Level:** \n   - Include more detailed instructions on how to perform the visual inspection of data distribution and how to modify subtype classification based on expert pathology reviews.\n   - Provide specific examples or references to supplementary information for clarity.\n\n2. **Factual Reliability:** \n   - Ensure that all steps are clearly explained and that any assumptions about the user's access to resources are minimized.\n   - Include alternative methods for users who do not have access to expert pathology reviews and supplementary information.\n\n3. **Relevance:** \n   - Be more explicit about how the selected samples will be used in subsequent steps of the experiment.\n\n4. **Referability and Modifications:** \n   - Mention any potential modifications that might be necessary based on the analysis of the referenced sources.\n\n5. **Logical Structure:** \n   - Break down the steps into smaller, more manageable tasks.\n   - Separate the selection criteria for tumor and normal samples into distinct sub-steps.\n\n### Final Integral Score:\nConsidering the strengths and areas for improvement, I would rate this part of the protocol a **4** out of 5. The protocol is generally well-detailed and relevant, but it could benefit from additional specificity and clarity in certain areas. \n\n**[4]**"

It also specifies the number of samples to be collected (N=11 for DDLPS, N=5 for WDLPS, N=1 for lipoma, and N=5 for normal adipose tissues).\n- **Weaknesses:** The protocol could benefit from more detailed instructions on the specific methods for tissue preservation (e.g., snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, fixation in formalin) and the conditions for storing frozen samples and paraffin sections. Additionally, it could include more specific examples or references to standard protocols for tissue preservation.\n\n#### 2. Factual Reliability:\n- **Strengths:** The details provided are accurate and align with standard practices for collecting and processing tumor samples.\n- **Weaknesses:** The protocol assumes that the user is familiar with standard protocols for tissue preservation and storage. It could include more background information or references to documentation for users who are less experienced.\n\n#### 3. Relevance:\n- **Strengths:** The protocol is highly relevant to the research objective of analyzing differences in metabolic characteristics between highly differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma.\n- **Weaknesses:** The protocol could be more explicit about how the collected samples will be used in subsequent steps of the experiment.\n\n#### 4. Referability and Modifications:\n- **Strengths:** The protocol reflects recommendations for referability by including specific sample types and numbers.\n- **Weaknesses:** It does not explicitly mention any modifications that might be necessary based on the analysis of the referenced sources.\n\n#### 5. Logical Structure:\n- **Strengths:** The protocol follows a logical sequence, starting with the collection of fresh tumor samples and moving towards the processing and storage of samples.\n- **Weaknesses:** The structure could be improved by breaking down the steps into smaller, more manageable tasks. For example, separating the collection, processing, and storage steps into distinct sub-steps.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n1. **Detail Level:** \n   - Include more detailed instructions on the specific methods for tissue preservation (e.g., snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, fixation in formalin) and the conditions for storing frozen samples and paraffin sections.\n   - Provide specific examples or references to standard protocols for tissue preservation.\n\n2. **Factual Reliability:** \n   - Ensure that all steps are clearly explained and that any assumptions about the user's familiarity with standard protocols are minimized.\n   - Include more background information or references to documentation for users who are less experienced.\n\n3. **Relevance:** \n   - Be more explicit about how the collected samples will be used in subsequent steps of the experiment.\n\n4. **Referability and Modifications:** \n   - Mention any potential modifications that might be necessary based on the analysis of the referenced sources.\n\n5. **Logical Structure:** \n   - Break down the steps into smaller, more manageable tasks.\n   - Separate the collection, processing, and storage steps into distinct sub-steps.\n\n### Final Integral Score:\nConsidering the strengths and areas for improvement, I would rate this part of the protocol a **4** out of 5. The protocol is generally well-detailed and relevant, but it could benefit from additional specificity and clarity in certain areas. \n\n**[4]**"

Here we investigated the impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin topology, gene expression and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma tumors and models. We identified three independent gene regulatory circuits that predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 family transcription factors bind a shared set of enhancers associated with mesenchymal lineage genes that underlie the developmental state of these tumors. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters associated with P53 pathways. When highly expressed, MDM2 also binds an additional set of P53-independent promoters that engage in multi-way physical interactions and regulate genes involved in cell division, RNA splicing, translation and stress responses. We find that liposarcoma cells with low to moderate MDM2 levels are sensitive to P53 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic agents, but that cells with very high-level MDM2 amplification and expression resist treatment. Hence, heterogeneity of MDM2 expression between and within tumors may compromise therapeutic regimens.

The two most frequent subtypes well differentiated (WD) and dedifferentiated (DD) LPS are often marked with the giant chromosome and the amplifications of chromosome 12q13-15. However, it remains unknown how this genomic aberrancy contributes to the dysregulation of the oncogenes. Here, we reported a comprehensive molecular characterization of both tumor and normal tissues from the same batch of LPS patients, including Hi-C, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and WGS datasets. We identified a library of tumor-specific enhancers that may play a critical role in oncogenesis. We also demonstrated the enhancer co-amplification and hijacking events involved with proto-oncogenes such as MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2, which have not been previously reported and as a novel mechanism to upregulate these genes. By combining Hi-C, optical mapping, Nanopore long reads and WGS data, we partially resolved complex structure variations (SVs) and reconstructed the local genome and the giant chromosome. We further validated the presence of multiple copies of  MDM2 and CDK4 are located on the giant chromosome by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

Each pair of patient samples contains one tumor tissue and one matched peritumoral tissue as control. To profile the transcribed regions and to reveal the differential transcriptomes between tumors and peritumoral tissues, we performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) in all patient samples and cell lines. In 4 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples (P241, P298, P69 and P209) and 1 DD-LPS cell line (Lipo863B), we performed 1) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA-seq (ChIP-seq) for histone modifications H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), to chart the open chromatin regions and DD-LPS-specific regulatory elements, such as enhancers; 2) Hi-C experiments to study high-order chromatin structure and link distal enhancers to their target genes; 3) whole genome sequencing (WGS) to profile CNVs and dissect genome rearrangements. To better reveal the sequence details of genome rearrangements, we performed Nanopore long-read sequencing and BioNano optical mapping in Lipo863B cells to help assemble the rearranged regions.

Transcription factors (TFs), including fusion oncoproteins, can bind to BAF complex surfaces to direct chromatin targeting and accessibility, often activating oncogenic gene loci. Here, we demonstrate that the FUS-DDIT3 fusion oncoprotein hallmark to myxoid liposarcoma (MLPS) inhibits BAF complex-mediated remodeling of adipogenic enhancer sites via sequestration of the adipogenic TF, CEBPB, from the genome. In mesenchymal stem cells, small molecule inhibition of BAF complex ATPase activity attenuates adipogenesis via failure of BAF-mediated DNA accessibility and gene activation at CEBPB target sites genome-wide. BAF chromatin targeting and gene expression profiles of FUS-DDIT3-expressing cell lines and primary tumors exhibit similarity to SMARCB1-deficient BAF loss-of-function tumor types.

It is characterized by a component of undifferentiated tumor cells coexisting with a component of well-differentiated adipocytic tumor cells. Both dedifferentiated (DD) and well-differentiated (WD) components exhibit MDM2 amplification, however their cellular origin remains elusive. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and functional assays in paired WD and DD components from primary DDLPS tumors, we characterized the cellular heterogeneity of DDLPS tumor and micro-environment. We identified a population of tumor adipocyte stem cells (ASC) showing striking similarities with adipocyte stromal progenitors found in white adipose tissue. We show that tumor ASC harbor the ancestral genomic alterations of WD and DD components, suggesting that both derive from these progenitors following clonal evolution.

Here we investigated the impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin topology, gene expression and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma tumors and models. We identified three independent gene regulatory circuits that predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 family transcription factors bind a shared set of enhancers associated with mesenchymal lineage genes that underlie the developmental state of these tumors. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters associated with P53 pathways. When highly expressed, MDM2 also binds an additional set of P53-independent promoters that engage in multi-way physical interactions and regulate genes involved in cell division, RNA splicing, translation and stress responses. We find that liposarcoma cells with low to moderate MDM2 levels are sensitive to P53 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic agents, but that cells with very high-level MDM2 amplification and expression resist treatment. Hence, heterogeneity of MDM2 expression between and within tumors may compromise therapeutic regimens. In conclusion, we distinguished P53-dependent and P53-independent circuits in MDM2 copy number amplified tumors whose interplay has implications for targeted therapy.', 'Overall design': 'Samples from liposarcoma.

Here we investigated the impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin topology, gene expression and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma tumors and models. We identified three independent gene regulatory circuits that predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 family transcription factors bind a shared set of enhancers associated with mesenchymal lineage genes that underlie the developmental state of these tumors. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters associated with P53 pathways. When highly expressed, MDM2 also binds an additional set of P53-independent promoters that engage in multi-way physical interactions and regulate genes involved in cell division, RNA splicing, translation and stress responses. We find that liposarcoma cells with low to moderate MDM2 levels are sensitive to P53 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic agents, but that cells with very high-level MDM2 amplification and expression resist treatment. Hence, heterogeneity of MDM2 expression between and within tumors may compromise therapeutic regimens. In conclusion, we distinguished P53-dependent and P53-independent circuits in MDM2 copy number amplified tumors whose interplay has implications for targeted therapy.', 'Overall design': 'Samples from liposarcoma.

Both dedifferentiated (DD) and well-differentiated (WD) components exhibit MDM2 amplification, however their cellular origin remains elusive. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and functional assays in paired WD and DD components from primary DDLPS tumors, we characterized the cellular heterogeneity of DDLPS tumor and micro-environment. We identified a population of tumor adipocyte stem cells (ASC) showing striking similarities with adipocyte stromal progenitors found in white adipose tissue. We show that tumor ASC harbor the ancestral genomic alterations of WD and DD components, suggesting that both derive from these progenitors following clonal evolution.

Here we investigated the impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin topology, gene expression and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma tumors and models. We identified three independent gene regulatory circuits that predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 family transcription factors bind a shared set of enhancers associated with mesenchymal lineage genes that underlie the developmental state of these tumors. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters associated with P53 pathways. When highly expressed, MDM2 also binds an additional set of P53-independent promoters that engage in multi-way physical interactions and regulate genes involved in cell division, RNA splicing, translation and stress responses. We find that liposarcoma cells with low to moderate MDM2 levels are sensitive to P53 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic agents, but that cells with very high-level MDM2 amplification and expression resist treatment. Hence, heterogeneity of MDM2 expression between and within tumors may compromise therapeutic regimens.

The two most frequent subtypes well differentiated (WD) and dedifferentiated (DD) LPS are often marked with the giant chromosome and the amplifications of chromosome 12q13-15. However, it remains unknown how this genomic aberrancy contributes to the dysregulation of the oncogenes. Here, we reported a comprehensive molecular characterization of both tumor and normal tissues from the same batch of LPS patients, including Hi-C, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and WGS datasets. We identified a library of tumor-specific enhancers that may play a critical role in oncogenesis. We also demonstrated the enhancer co-amplification and hijacking events involved with proto-oncogenes such as MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2, which have not been previously reported and as a novel mechanism to upregulate these genes. By combining Hi-C, optical mapping, Nanopore long reads and WGS data, we partially resolved complex structure variations (SVs) and reconstructed the local genome and the giant chromosome. We further validated the presence of multiple copies of  MDM2 and CDK4 are located on the giant chromosome by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

Each pair of patient samples contains one tumor tissue and one matched peritumoral tissue as control. To profile the transcribed regions and to reveal the differential transcriptomes between tumors and peritumoral tissues, we performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) in all patient samples and cell lines. In 4 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples (P241, P298, P69 and P209) and 1 DD-LPS cell line (Lipo863B), we performed 1) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA-seq (ChIP-seq) for histone modifications H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), to chart the open chromatin regions and DD-LPS-specific regulatory elements, such as enhancers; 2) Hi-C experiments to study high-order chromatin structure and link distal enhancers to their target genes; 3) whole genome sequencing (WGS) to profile CNVs and dissect genome rearrangements. To better reveal the sequence details of genome rearrangements, we performed Nanopore long-read sequencing and BioNano optical mapping in Lipo863B cells to help assemble the rearranged regions.

Transcription factors (TFs), including fusion oncoproteins, can bind to BAF complex surfaces to direct chromatin targeting and accessibility, often activating oncogenic gene loci. Here, we demonstrate that the FUS-DDIT3 fusion oncoprotein hallmark to myxoid liposarcoma (MLPS) inhibits BAF complex-mediated remodeling of adipogenic enhancer sites via sequestration of the adipogenic TF, CEBPB, from the genome. In mesenchymal stem cells, small molecule inhibition of BAF complex ATPase activity attenuates adipogenesis via failure of BAF-mediated DNA accessibility and gene activation at CEBPB target sites genome-wide. BAF chromatin targeting and gene expression profiles of FUS-DDIT3-expressing cell lines and primary tumors exhibit similarity to SMARCB1-deficient BAF loss-of-function tumor types.

Both dedifferentiated (DD) and well-differentiated (WD) components exhibit MDM2 amplification, however their cellular origin remains elusive. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and functional assays in paired WD and DD components from primary DDLPS tumors, we characterized the cellular heterogeneity of DDLPS tumor and micro-environment. We identified a population of tumor adipocyte stem cells (ASC) showing striking similarities with adipocyte stromal progenitors found in white adipose tissue. We show that tumor ASC harbor the ancestral genomic alterations of WD and DD components, suggesting that both derive from these progenitors following clonal evolution.

Here we investigated the impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin topology, gene expression and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma tumors and models. We identified three independent gene regulatory circuits that predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 family transcription factors bind a shared set of enhancers associated with mesenchymal lineage genes that underlie the developmental state of these tumors. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters associated with P53 pathways. When highly expressed, MDM2 also binds an additional set of P53-independent promoters that engage in multi-way physical interactions and regulate genes involved in cell division, RNA splicing, translation and stress responses. We find that liposarcoma cells with low to moderate MDM2 levels are sensitive to P53 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic agents, but that cells with very high-level MDM2 amplification and expression resist treatment. Hence, heterogeneity of MDM2 expression between and within tumors may compromise therapeutic regimens.
