        "input": "$Part 1 of Experimental protocol to be processed$: Part 1: Sample Collection and Preparation\n\nI. Data Download from Recount3 and TCGA:\n1. Download raw gene counts for tumor and normal tissue samples using the Recount3 R package (version 1.0).\n2. Ensure uniform processing of raw reads from multiple sources (TCGA and GTEx) using STAR (version 2.7.3a) and Megadepth (version 1.0.1) to align and quantify the reads to the UCSC hg38 assembly.\n3. Access and download raw gene counts using the following commands:\n\nR\nlibrary(recount3)\nproject_info <- available_projects()\ndata_sarc <- create_rse(project = 'TCGA-SARC')\ndata_gtex <- create_rse(project = 'GTEx')\n\n4. Verify the integrity of the downloaded data using checksum or md5sum to ensure data integrity.\n5. Handle potential errors during data download and alignment by referring to the Recount3 and STAR documentation for troubleshooting.\n6. Selected data from GTEx tissues include 1293 adipose, 520 fibroblasts, 881 skeletal muscle, 553 esophagus muscularis, 384 stomach, 159 uterus, and 946 vessels. From TCGA, the 206 sarcoma samples include 50 dedifferentiated liposarcomas (DDLPS), 80 leiomyosarcomas, 5 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), 17 myxofibrosarcomas (MFS), 10 synovial sarcomas (SS), and 44 undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS).\n\nII. Selection Criteria for Sarcoma and Normal Tissue Samples:\n1. Tumor samples obtained from the SARC project, belonging to the TCGA consortium.\n2. Normal samples downloaded from multiple tissue projects of the GTEx consortium, specifically adipose, uterus, esophagus, stomach, blood vessel, muscle, and skin fibroblasts.\n3. Filter out low-quality and non-primary tumor samples from the sarcoma project based on read alignment statistics (percentage of aligned reads > 70%) and visual inspection of data distribution.\n4. Modify subtype classification according to previous expert pathology reviews.\n5. Adjust sample selection criteria based on the specific research focus on highly differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma.\n\nIII. Tissue Dissociation and Cell Isolation from Frozen Tissues, Cell Lines, and Paraffin Sections:\n1. Cut fresh tumor samples into small pieces and dissociate the tissue for 30 minutes at 37°C in a CO2-independent medium containing 150 mg/ml of Liberase TL and 100 U/ml of DNase.\n2. For cell lines, thaw frozen cells and resuspend in the CO2-independent medium with the same concentrations of Liberase TL and DNase.\n3. For paraffin sections, deparaffinize sections using xylene and rehydrate through graded alcohols before dissociation.\n4. Filter the dissociated cells using a 100 µm cell strainer and wash with PBS.\n5. Remove debris by centrifugation (3000 × g for 10 minutes at 4°C) using the debris removal solution.\n6. Resuspend cells in PBS, count, and adjust the concentration to 1 million cells per ml.\n7. Verify cell viability using the Trypan Blue exclusion method and ensure high-quality single-cell suspensions.\n8. Integrate the downloaded data with existing frozen samples, cell lines, and paraffin sections for comprehensive analysis.\n\nIV. Preprocessing of Raw Gene Counts (quality control, filtering):\n1. Keep genomic features mapped to an Entrez ID on the org.Hs.eg.db Bioconductor package (version 3.12.0).\n2. Normalize the downloaded raw counts for all samples using the Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) method, as implemented in the edgeR package (version 3.32.1).\n3. Obtain normalized counts in the log scale with the voom function provided in the limma package (version 3.46.0).\n4. Perform quality control checks on the raw gene counts, including visualizing the data distribution, checking for outliers, and ensuring data integrity using specific R packages for data quality assessment (e.g., edgeR, limma).\n5. Handle discrepancies between expected and actual data by re-evaluating the sample selection criteria and preprocessing steps.\n6. Use specific commands for quality control checks, such as plotMDS in edgeR for visualizing data distribution and identify outliers using boxplots or scatter plots.\n7. Verify the accuracy of the normalized counts by comparing with known control samples or reference datasets.\n\nV. Normalization of Gene Counts using TMM method:\n1. Normalize raw gene counts using the TMM method to account for differences in library sizes and composition.\n2. Apply the voom function to transform the normalized counts to log2 counts per million (CPM) and estimate the mean-variance relationship.\n3. Justify the choice of normalization methods, explaining how the TMM method and voom function address potential biases and ensure accurate downstream analysis.\n4. Consider alternative normalization methods (e.g., DESeq2) and provide a rationale for selecting the TMM and voom approaches.\n5. Ensure that the normalization methods preserve the biological information of samples by comparing sample clustering using t-SNE or heatmap.\n6. Make explicit connections between the preprocessing steps and subsequent analysis by detailing how the normalized counts will be used in downstream differential expression analysis and pathway enrichment analysis.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 1 of experimental protocol.

For instance, specifying the format of the input data (e.g., file types) and the expected format of the output (e.g., specific data structures) would provide clearer guidance.\n   - The task descriptions could include more information about the software versions used, as these are critical for reproducibility and were specified in the original protocol.\n   - The extraction could also include more detail on error handling and troubleshooting, as these are important aspects of computational protocols.\n\n**Specific Areas for Improvement:**\n\n- **Task Descriptions:** Enhance the descriptions by including the rationale behind each step, such as why certain software or methods are used. This would provide more context and align better with the original protocol's intent.\n  \n- **Input and Output Details:** Specify the file types and data structures expected for both inputs and outputs. For example, mention if the raw gene counts are expected as CSV files or R data frames.\n\n- **Software Versions:** Include the specific versions of software and packages used, as mentioned in the protocol, to ensure reproducibility.\n\n- **Error Handling:** Add a section on potential errors and troubleshooting steps, as these are often part of computational protocols.\n\n- **Linking Steps:** Clearly link each task to subsequent steps, showing how the output of one task serves as the input for the next.

        "input": "$Part 2 of Experimental protocol to be processed$: Part 2: RNA-Sequencing Data Collection and Preprocessing\n\nI. Data Collection from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and other relevant datasets:\n1. Collect RNA-sequencing data from the CCLE database (23Q2 release) ensuring it includes 1,341 cell lines representing 41 major cancer types.\n2. Collect additional RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), TARGET, and Treehouse databases if needed.\n3. Download RNA-sequencing data from publicly available datasets such as GSE213300, GSE201056, GSE179720, GSE221493, and GSE221492.\n4. Ensure the dataset includes 80 cases of liposarcoma and 10 single-cell sequencing cases.\n5. Provide accession numbers or links to the datasets: CCLE (https://depmap.org/portal/), TCGA (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga), TARGET (https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target), Treehouse (https://treehousegenomics.ucsc.edu/), GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).\n6. Organize the downloaded datasets into a structured directory format for easy access and integration.\n7. Merge datasets from different sources, ensuring consistent sample identifiers and metadata alignment.\n\nII. Quality Control Checks using FastQC:\n1. Perform quality control checks on the raw RNA-sequencing data to ensure data integrity using FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).\n2. Check for common quality metrics including per base sequence quality, per sequence GC content, and sequence duplication levels.\n3. Generate a summary report for each dataset and identify any samples that do not meet quality standards.\n4. Interpret FastQC reports to identify issues such as low-quality reads, adapter contamination, and overrepresented sequences.\n5. Handle low-quality samples by either re-sequencing or excluding them from further analysis based on the severity of quality issues.\n\nIII. Removal of Low-Quality Reads with Trimmomatic:\n1. Use Trimmomatic (http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) to remove low-quality reads and sequences with low expression levels.\n2. Apply the following parameter settings: LEADING:3, TRAILING:3, SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15, MINLEN:36.\n3. Generate a summary report of the trimmed reads and ensure that the quality of the remaining reads is satisfactory.\n4. Re-run FastQC on the trimmed reads to confirm the improvement in quality.\n\nIV. Normalization Techniques using RSEM (TPM, RPKM, FPKM):\n1. Normalize expression levels using RSEM (https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM) to Transcripts Per Million (TPM), Reads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped reads (RPKM), and Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM).\n2. Apply log2 transformation (log2(TPM+1)) and z-score normalization for further analysis.\n3. Generate a normalized expression matrix for all samples and ensure the data is ready for downstream analysis.\n4. Validate normalization by checking for uniform distribution of expression levels across samples.\n\nV. Identification of Metabolic Genes and Pathways from KEGG Database:\n1. Identify 1,620 genes representing 85 different metabolic pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database.\n2. Download and map these genes to the RNA-sequencing data for further analysis.\n3. Ensure the KEGG database is accessed at https://www.genome.jp/kegg/.\n4. Generate a list of metabolic genes and their corresponding expression levels for all samples.\n5. Verify the accuracy of gene mapping by cross-referencing with KEGG pathway annotations.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 2 of experimental protocol.

                        "text": "$Part 2 of Experimental protocol to be processed$: Part 2: RNA-Sequencing Data Collection and Preprocessing\n\nI. Data Collection from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and other relevant datasets:\n1. Collect RNA-sequencing data from the CCLE database (23Q2 release) ensuring it includes 1,341 cell lines representing 41 major cancer types.\n2. Collect additional RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), TARGET, and Treehouse databases if needed.\n3. Download RNA-sequencing data from publicly available datasets such as GSE213300, GSE201056, GSE179720, GSE221493, and GSE221492.\n4. Ensure the dataset includes 80 cases of liposarcoma and 10 single-cell sequencing cases.\n5. Provide accession numbers or links to the datasets: CCLE (https://depmap.org/portal/), TCGA (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga), TARGET (https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target), Treehouse (https://treehousegenomics.ucsc.edu/), GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).\n6. Organize the downloaded datasets into a structured directory format for easy access and integration.\n7. Merge datasets from different sources, ensuring consistent sample identifiers and metadata alignment.\n\nII. Quality Control Checks using FastQC:\n1. Perform quality control checks on the raw RNA-sequencing data to ensure data integrity using FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).\n2. Check for common quality metrics including per base sequence quality, per sequence GC content, and sequence duplication levels.\n3. Generate a summary report for each dataset and identify any samples that do not meet quality standards.\n4. Interpret FastQC reports to identify issues such as low-quality reads, adapter contamination, and overrepresented sequences.\n5. Handle low-quality samples by either re-sequencing or excluding them from further analysis based on the severity of quality issues.\n\nIII. Removal of Low-Quality Reads with Trimmomatic:\n1. Use Trimmomatic (http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) to remove low-quality reads and sequences with low expression levels.\n2. Apply the following parameter settings: LEADING:3, TRAILING:3, SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15, MINLEN:36.\n3. Generate a summary report of the trimmed reads and ensure that the quality of the remaining reads is satisfactory.\n4. Re-run FastQC on the trimmed reads to confirm the improvement in quality.\n\nIV. Normalization Techniques using RSEM (TPM, RPKM, FPKM):\n1. Normalize expression levels using RSEM (https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM) to Transcripts Per Million (TPM), Reads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped reads (RPKM), and Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM).\n2. Apply log2 transformation (log2(TPM+1)) and z-score normalization for further analysis.\n3. Generate a normalized expression matrix for all samples and ensure the data is ready for downstream analysis.\n4. Validate normalization by checking for uniform distribution of expression levels across samples.\n\nV. Identification of Metabolic Genes and Pathways from KEGG Database:\n1. Identify 1,620 genes representing 85 different metabolic pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database.\n2. Download and map these genes to the RNA-sequencing data for further analysis.\n3. Ensure the KEGG database is accessed at https://www.genome.jp/kegg/.\n4. Generate a list of metabolic genes and their corresponding expression levels for all samples.\n5. Verify the accuracy of gene mapping by cross-referencing with KEGG pathway annotations.\n\n  \nReview the provided Part 2 of experimental protocol.

Each task is clearly defined, and the descriptions align well with the protocol's objectives. The inputs and outputs are generally consistent with the protocol's requirements, ensuring that the tasks are relevant to dry experiments.\n\n**Detail:**\nThe extraction captures the experimental steps with a good level of detail. However, there are still areas where additional specificity could enhance the clarity and completeness of the tasks. For example, the description of inputs and outputs could benefit from more precise definitions, such as specifying file types and formats more consistently across tasks.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Consistency in File Formats:**\n   - Ensure that the file formats for inputs and outputs are consistently specified across all tasks. For instance, while some tasks mention FASTQ files, others could specify additional formats like BAM or CSV where applicable.\n\n2. **Clarification of Tools and Parameters:**\n   - For tasks involving specific tools like FastQC and Trimmomatic, include the exact parameters or settings used in the analysis. This would provide a clearer understanding of the processing steps.\n\n3. **Enhanced Detail in Outputs:**\n   - Outputs could be described in more detail, particularly in terms of the expected content and structure. For example, when mentioning \"normalized expression matrix,\" specify the dimensions or key features of the matrix.\n\n4. **Inclusion of Data Integration Steps:**\n   - While the merging of datasets is mentioned, further detail on how metadata alignment is achieved could be beneficial. This might include specific strategies or tools used for integration.\n\n5. **Validation and Verification Steps:**\n   - Include more explicit steps for validation and verification of data quality and normalization, such as statistical tests or visualizations used to confirm uniform distribution.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the extraction can be made more comprehensive and informative, providing a clearer roadmap for executing the dry experimental tasks.\n\n**Final Score: [4]**"

Data Normalization: Normalize RNA-seq data using the Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) method as implemented in the edgeR package (version 3.32.1). Specify the scaling factors and assumptions for non-differentially expressed genes. Use datasets GSE213300, GSE201056, GSE179720, GSE221493, and GSE221492 for normalization.\n2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by filtering out low-quality and non-primary tumor samples from the sarcoma project. Use criteria such as minimum read counts (>10), quality scores (Phred score >30), and only keep genomic features mapped to an Entrez ID on the org.Hs.eg.db Bioconductor package (version 3.12.0). Example command: `filtered_data <- filterByExpr(expression_data, min.count=10, min.total.count=15)`.\n3. Linear Model Fitting: Fit a linear model to the normalized data using the limma package (version 3.46.0). Use the design matrix to include sarcoma subtypes and normal tissues. Example command: `fit <- lmFit(expression_data, design)`.\n4. Batch Effect Correction: Include tissue source site as a batch effect in the model matrix to correct for batch effects. Example command: `batch_corrected <- removeBatchEffect(expression_data, batch=batch)`.\n5. Differential Expression Analysis: Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially activated circuits between sarcoma subtypes and normal tissues using the empirical Bayes method. Set p-value thresholds at <0.05 and adjust for false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Example command: `deg <- topTable(fit, adjust.method='BH', number=Inf)`.\n6. Validation Methods: Validate results by cross-referencing with other datasets or using additional statistical tests to confirm findings. Ensure reproducibility by performing the analysis on different subsets of data. Cross-reference findings with existing knowledge to ensure accuracy.

Consider adding a brief mention of validation steps where applicable, to provide a more comprehensive view of the computational workflow.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the extraction can be made more comprehensive and aligned with the original protocol, providing a clearer and more detailed guide for executing the dry experimental tasks.\n\nOverall, the extraction is well-executed but could benefit from additional detail and precision in certain areas.

However, some tasks could benefit from more precise descriptions to ensure they fully align with the protocol. For example, the task descriptions could specify the use of particular software tools or parameters as mentioned in the protocol (e.g., STAR and featureCounts parameters).\n\n2. **Detail**:\n   - While the extraction captures the general steps, it could include more detailed descriptions of the inputs and outputs. For instance, specifying the format of the input files (e.g., FASTQ for RNA-seq reads) and the expected format of outputs (e.g., CSV for pathway activity scores) would provide greater clarity.\n   - The extraction could also benefit from including more specific details about the statistical methods or software functions used in the analysis, as mentioned in the protocol (e.g., Fisher's exact test, edgeR functions).\n\n**Areas for Improvement**:\n- **Task Descriptions**: Enhance the task descriptions by including specific software tools and parameters used in each step, as outlined in the protocol. This would improve the alignment with the original protocol.\n- **Input and Output Details**: Provide more detailed descriptions of the input and output formats, including file types and structures. This would help in understanding the data flow and expected results more clearly.\n- **Statistical Methods**: Include specific statistical methods or tests used in the analysis, as these are crucial for understanding the computational approach.\n\n**Modification Suggestions**:\n- For each task, explicitly mention the software tools and parameters used, such as STAR for alignment with specific parameters.\n- Specify the file formats for inputs and outputs, such as FASTQ for RNA-seq reads and CSV for expression data.\n- Include details about the statistical tests or methods used, such as Fisher's exact test for enrichment analysis.\n\nOverall, the extraction is well-organized but could be improved with more detailed and precise information to fully capture the complexity and specificity of the protocol.

However, there are a few areas where the alignment could be improved, particularly in ensuring that all relevant details from the protocol are included in the extraction.\n\n**Detail: 3/5**\n- While the extraction captures the main steps, it could benefit from more detailed descriptions of the inputs and outputs. Some steps lack specificity regarding the types of data or the expected outcomes, which could lead to ambiguity in understanding the tasks.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Consistency in Task Descriptions:**\n   - Ensure that each task description is consistent in its level of detail. Some tasks are described more thoroughly than others, which can lead to confusion. For example, the description of the integration of single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data could include more specifics about the methods used.\n\n2. **Input and Output Specificity:**\n   - Provide more detailed descriptions of the inputs and outputs. For instance, when mentioning datasets, specify the type of data they contain (e.g., raw counts, normalized data) and any preprocessing steps that have been applied. Similarly, outputs should clearly state the format or type of data produced (e.g., lists, plots, matrices).\n\n3. **Clarification of Analytical Methods:**\n   - Some steps mention the use of specific functions or packages (e.g., Seurat, ClusterProfiler) without detailing the parameters or settings used. Including this information would enhance the clarity and reproducibility of the protocol.\n\n4. **Logical Flow and Structure:**\n   - Ensure that the tasks are presented in a logical sequence that mirrors the workflow of the original protocol. This will help users follow the process more intuitively.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Rationale:**\n   - Where applicable, include a brief rationale for the choice of specific methods or datasets. This can provide context and help users understand the purpose behind each step.\n\n**Modification Suggestions:**\n\n- **Task Descriptions:** Expand on the descriptions to include the purpose and expected outcomes of each task. For example, explain why certain clustering resolutions are chosen or the significance of integrating datasets.\n  \n- **Input/Output Details:** Specify the format and type of data for both inputs and outputs. For instance, mention whether the output is a list of genes, a matrix of expression values, or a visualization plot.\n\n- **Analytical Methods:** Include details about the parameters used in functions like `FindMarkers` or `IntegrateData`, as well as any assumptions or considerations taken into account during analysis.\n\n- **Rationale and Context:** Add brief explanations for the selection of datasets and tools, highlighting their relevance to the research objectives.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the extraction can be made more comprehensive and user-friendly, ensuring that it serves as a clear and detailed guide for conducting the dry experiments outlined in the protocol.\n\n**Final Score: [3.5]**"
