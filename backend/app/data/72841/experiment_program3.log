Here we investigated the impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin topology, gene expression and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma tumors and models. We identified three independent gene regulatory circuits that predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 family transcription factors bind a shared set of enhancers associated with mesenchymal lineage genes that underlie the developmental state of these tumors. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters associated with P53 pathways. When highly expressed, MDM2 also binds an additional set of P53-independent promoters that engage in multi-way physical interactions and regulate genes involved in cell division, RNA splicing, translation and stress responses. We find that liposarcoma cells with low to moderate MDM2 levels are sensitive to P53 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic agents, but that cells with very high-level MDM2 amplification and expression resist treatment. Hence, heterogeneity of MDM2 expression between and within tumors may compromise therapeutic regimens. In conclusion, we distinguished P53-dependent and P53-independent circuits in MDM2 copy number amplified tumors whose interplay has implications for targeted therapy.', 'Overall design': 'Samples from liposarcoma.

The two most frequent subtypes well differentiated (WD) and dedifferentiated (DD) LPS are often marked with the giant chromosome and the amplifications of chromosome 12q13-15. However, it remains unknown how this genomic aberrancy contributes to the dysregulation of the oncogenes. Here, we reported a comprehensive molecular characterization of both tumor and normal tissues from the same batch of LPS patients, including Hi-C, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and WGS datasets. We identified a library of tumor-specific enhancers that may play a critical role in oncogenesis. We also demonstrated the enhancer co-amplification and hijacking events involved with proto-oncogenes such as MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2, which have not been previously reported and as a novel mechanism to upregulate these genes. By combining Hi-C, optical mapping, Nanopore long reads and WGS data, we partially resolved complex structure variations (SVs) and reconstructed the local genome and the giant chromosome.

Here, we demonstrate that the FUS-DDIT3 fusion oncoprotein hallmark to myxoid liposarcoma (MLPS) inhibits BAF complex-mediated remodeling of adipogenic enhancer sites via sequestration of the adipogenic TF, CEBPB, from the genome. In mesenchymal stem cells, small molecule inhibition of BAF complex ATPase activity attenuates adipogenesis via failure of BAF-mediated DNA accessibility and gene activation at CEBPB target sites genome-wide. BAF chromatin targeting and gene expression profiles of FUS-DDIT3-expressing cell lines and primary tumors exhibit similarity to SMARCB1-deficient BAF loss-of-function tumor types.

It is characterized by a component of undifferentiated tumor cells coexisting with a component of well-differentiated adipocytic tumor cells. Both dedifferentiated (DD) and well-differentiated (WD) components exhibit MDM2 amplification, however their cellular origin remains elusive. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and functional assays in paired WD and DD components from primary DDLPS tumors, we characterized the cellular heterogeneity of DDLPS tumor and micro-environment. We identified a population of tumor adipocyte stem cells (ASC) showing striking similarities with adipocyte stromal progenitors found in white adipose tissue. We show that tumor ASC harbor the ancestral genomic alterations of WD and DD components, suggesting that both derive from these progenitors following clonal evolution.

Here we investigated the impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin topology, gene expression and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma tumors and models. We identified three independent gene regulatory circuits that predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 family transcription factors bind a shared set of enhancers associated with mesenchymal lineage genes that underlie the developmental state of these tumors. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters associated with P53 pathways. When highly expressed, MDM2 also binds an additional set of P53-independent promoters that engage in multi-way physical interactions and regulate genes involved in cell division, RNA splicing, translation and stress responses. We find that liposarcoma cells with low to moderate MDM2 levels are sensitive to P53 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic agents, but that cells with very high-level MDM2 amplification and expression resist treatment. Hence, heterogeneity of MDM2 expression between and within tumors may compromise therapeutic regimens.

Here we investigated the impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin topology, gene expression and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma tumors and models. We identified three independent gene regulatory circuits that predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 family transcription factors bind a shared set of enhancers associated with mesenchymal lineage genes that underlie the developmental state of these tumors. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters associated with P53 pathways. When highly expressed, MDM2 also binds an additional set of P53-independent promoters that engage in multi-way physical interactions and regulate genes involved in cell division, RNA splicing, translation and stress responses. We find that liposarcoma cells with low to moderate MDM2 levels are sensitive to P53 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic agents, but that cells with very high-level MDM2 amplification and expression resist treatment. Hence, heterogeneity of MDM2 expression between and within tumors may compromise therapeutic regimens. In conclusion, we distinguished P53-dependent and P53-independent circuits in MDM2 copy number amplified tumors whose interplay has implications for targeted therapy.', 'Overall design': 'Samples from liposarcoma.

Here we investigated the impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin topology, gene expression and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma tumors and models. We identified three independent gene regulatory circuits that predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 family transcription factors bind a shared set of enhancers associated with mesenchymal lineage genes that underlie the developmental state of these tumors. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters associated with P53 pathways. When highly expressed, MDM2 also binds an additional set of P53-independent promoters that engage in multi-way physical interactions and regulate genes involved in cell division, RNA splicing, translation and stress responses. We find that liposarcoma cells with low to moderate MDM2 levels are sensitive to P53 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic agents, but that cells with very high-level MDM2 amplification and expression resist treatment. Hence, heterogeneity of MDM2 expression between and within tumors may compromise therapeutic regimens. In conclusion, we distinguished P53-dependent and P53-independent circuits in MDM2 copy number amplified tumors whose interplay has implications for targeted therapy.', 'Overall design': 'Samples from liposarcoma.

The two most frequent subtypes well differentiated (WD) and dedifferentiated (DD) LPS are often marked with the giant chromosome and the amplifications of chromosome 12q13-15.

Here, we reported a comprehensive molecular characterization of both tumor and normal tissues from the same batch of LPS patients, including Hi-C, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and WGS datasets. We identified a library of tumor-specific enhancers that may play a critical role in oncogenesis.

Here, we demonstrate that the FUS-DDIT3 fusion oncoprotein hallmark to myxoid liposarcoma (MLPS) inhibits BAF complex-mediated remodeling of adipogenic enhancer sites via sequestration of the adipogenic TF, CEBPB, from the genome. In mesenchymal stem cells, small molecule inhibition of BAF complex ATPase activity attenuates adipogenesis via failure of BAF-mediated DNA accessibility and gene activation at CEBPB target sites genome-wide.

It is characterized by a component of undifferentiated tumor cells coexisting with a component of well-differentiated adipocytic tumor cells. Both dedifferentiated (DD) and well-differentiated (WD) components exhibit MDM2 amplification, however their cellular origin remains elusive. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and functional assays in paired WD and DD components from primary DDLPS tumors, we characterized the cellular heterogeneity of DDLPS tumor and micro-environment. We identified a population of tumor adipocyte stem cells (ASC) showing striking similarities with adipocyte stromal progenitors found in white adipose tissue. We show that tumor ASC harbor the ancestral genomic alterations of WD and DD components, suggesting that both derive from these progenitors following clonal evolution.

Here we investigated the impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin topology, gene expression and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma tumors and models. We identified three independent gene regulatory circuits that predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 family transcription factors bind a shared set of enhancers associated with mesenchymal lineage genes that underlie the developmental state of these tumors. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters associated with P53 pathways. When highly expressed, MDM2 also binds an additional set of P53-independent promoters that engage in multi-way physical interactions and regulate genes involved in cell division, RNA splicing, translation and stress responses. We find that liposarcoma cells with low to moderate MDM2 levels are sensitive to P53 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic agents, but that cells with very high-level MDM2 amplification and expression resist treatment. Hence, heterogeneity of MDM2 expression between and within tumors may compromise therapeutic regimens.

We also demonstrated the enhancer co-amplification and hijacking events involved with proto-oncogenes such as MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2, which have not been previously reported and as a novel mechanism to upregulate these genes. By combining Hi-C, optical mapping, Nanopore long reads and WGS data, we partially resolved complex structure variations (SVs) and reconstructed the local genome and the giant chromosome. We further validated the presence of multiple copies of  MDM2 and CDK4 are located on the giant chromosome by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Consequently, this study provides a comprehensive resource for further research in LPS.', 'Overall design': 'We started with 5 pairs of WD-LPS, 14 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples, and 1 DD-LPS cell line. Each pair of patient samples contains one tumor tissue and one matched peritumoral tissue as control. To profile the transcribed regions and to reveal the differential transcriptomes between tumors and peritumoral tissues, we performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) in all patient samples and cell lines. In 4 pairs of DD-LPS patient samples (P241, P298, P69 and P209) and 1 DD-LPS cell line (Lipo863B), we performed 1) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA-seq (ChIP-seq) for histone modifications H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), to chart the open chromatin regions and DD-LPS-specific regulatory elements, such as enhancers; 2) Hi-C experiments to study high-order chromatin structure and link distal enhancers to their target genes; 3) whole genome sequencing (WGS) to profile CNVs and dissect genome rearrangements. To better reveal the sequence details of genome rearrangements, we performed Nanopore long-read sequencing and BioNano optical mapping in Lipo863B cells to help assemble the rearranged regions.

Transcription factors (TFs), including fusion oncoproteins, can bind to BAF complex surfaces to direct chromatin targeting and accessibility, often activating oncogenic gene loci. Here, we demonstrate that the FUS-DDIT3 fusion oncoprotein hallmark to myxoid liposarcoma (MLPS) inhibits BAF complex-mediated remodeling of adipogenic enhancer sites via sequestration of the adipogenic TF, CEBPB, from the genome. In mesenchymal stem cells, small molecule inhibition of BAF complex ATPase activity attenuates adipogenesis via failure of BAF-mediated DNA accessibility and gene activation at CEBPB target sites genome-wide. BAF chromatin targeting and gene expression profiles of FUS-DDIT3-expressing cell lines and primary tumors exhibit similarity to SMARCB1-deficient BAF loss-of-function tumor types.
