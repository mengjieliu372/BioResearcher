        "Title": "Identification and Enrichment of Hedgehog Signaling in Dedifferentiated Adipose Progenitors and DDLPS Tumors",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "This part focuses on the identification and enrichment of Hedgehog signaling in dedifferentiated adipose progenitors and DDLPS tumors, which is relevant to understanding molecular differences in liposarcoma differentiation.",
        "Suggestions": "Use the datasets GSE30929 and GSE20697 for differential gene expression analysis. Apply the limma package in R for identifying DEGs. Consider including RNA-seq data from your own 80 cases for a comprehensive analysis. Modify the criteria to include RNA-seq data and consider single-cell sequencing data for more detailed insights. Ensure that the budget and computational resources are considered when planning the data acquisition and analysis steps. Provide a step-by-step methodology for RNA-seq data analysis, including quality control, normalization (e.g., TPM, FPKM), differential expression analysis (e.g., DESeq2, edgeR), and pathway enrichment analysis (e.g., GSEA). Emphasize the importance of validation and cross-validation of results using independent datasets or subsets of the data to ensure reproducibility and robustness of the findings."

        "Title": "Analysis of Chromosome 12q13-12q15 Amplification and Its Impact on Gli1 and Gli2 Expression",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "The analysis of chromosomal amplification and its impact on gene expression is relevant but may require modification to fit the RNA-seq data focus of your research.",
        "Suggestions": "Use CBioPortal to access relevant cohorts and analyze chromosomal amplification. Incorporate RNA-seq data from your own 80 cases to evaluate Gli1 and Gli2 expression. Modify the methodology to include RNA-seq specific normalization and analysis techniques. Consider the budget and computational resources when planning the data acquisition and analysis steps. Include a section on validation strategies, such as using independent datasets or performing cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the findings."

    "Part 3": {
        "Title": "Elevated Gli2 Expression and Hedgehog Signaling in DDLPS Tumors",
        "Referability": "High",
        "Reason": "This part examines the expression of Gli1 and Gli2 and their roles in Hedgehog signaling, which is directly relevant to understanding the molecular characteristics of liposarcoma.",
        "Suggestions": "Utilize the GSE21122 and GSE30929 datasets for comparison. Apply RNA-seq data from your cases to validate findings. Perform GSEA using your own RNA-seq data to identify enriched pathways. Adjust the analysis to include RNA-seq specific methodologies. Ensure that the budget and computational resources are considered when planning the data acquisition and analysis steps. Provide detailed steps for integrating single-cell sequencing data with bulk RNA-seq data, including data preprocessing, clustering, and differential expression analysis at the single-cell level."

    "Part 4": {
        "Title": "Co-Expression Analysis of Gli2 with ECM and Immune Cell Markers in DDLPS Tumors",
        "Referability": "Medium",
        "Reason": "The co-expression analysis of Gli2 with ECM and immune cell markers is relevant but may need adjustments to fit the RNA-seq data focus.",
        "Suggestions": "Perform co-expression analysis using RNA-seq data from your 80 cases and validate with single-cell sequencing data. Use bioinformatics tools like CBioPortal and ShinyGO for functional enrichment analysis. Modify the approach to include RNA-seq specific analysis techniques. Ensure that the budget and computational resources are considered when planning the data acquisition and analysis steps. Provide a more detailed experimental design, including sample preparation, sequencing protocols, and data preprocessing steps, to ensure clarity and reproducibility."
